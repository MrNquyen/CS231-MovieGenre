When the audience meets Skye Riley at the start of the story, we are meant to recognize her as an established, world-renowned star and that's something you can simply sell by having her be interviewed by a well-known real-world talk show host. In Finn's words, \"I really, in building this pop star of Skye Riley played by Naomi Scott, wanted to lend credibility to the character and sort of blur the lines between reality and fiction and make her feel almost like she really existed in our world. And so I had this idea of introducing her on a talk show, but I was like, I want to do a real talk show.\" Drew Barrymore has been hosting The Drew Barrymore Show since 2020, and Parker Finn said he wrote the early scene with her in mind. He wrote to her, including the script pages, hoping that she might take the part, and he was delighted to get a yes. The writer/director continued: \"I love Drew Barrymore and I wrote the scene and then I sent it to her and I also wrote a letter to her and she was so gracious and said yes, and it was it was such a like fun dream to get to work with her and to do that.\"",

Paramount sued Chubb in 2021, and the two companies settled in 2022. In 2023, Chubb gave Paramount a £57 million (about $71 million) payout for the COVID-caused delays, reducing the film's budget to about $220 million, which still makes it the most expensive film for Cruise, Paramount, and the franchise.",

This was because the film was originally made for TV, with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (or 16:9) in mind -- without the projectionists' manual correction, the aspect ratio of the theatrical release (1.85:1) would have resulted in heads being cut off at the top of the silver screen. Lynch also asked to raise the volume of the theater's sound system by three decibels when the film was playing. The note ended with the words, \"Your friend, David Lynch.\"",

He later suggested that there may even be a fourth prequel film. However, the future of the series became uncertain after the purchase of 20th Century Fox by Disney in December 2017. The next film, tentatively titled 'Alien: Awakening', was set to enter preproduction that same month, but according to some sources, the project was shelved indefinitely. The commercial underperformance of Alien: Covenant as well as its lukewarm reception by critics and fans were named as reasons, although no official statements were made by Disney. In early 2019, however, the script called Alien: Awakening was actively being written, and Untitled Alien Prequel was officially in production as of 2022.",

Due to a 1978 landmark government ruling (Oliphant v. Suquamish), the Supreme Court stripped tribes of the right to arrest and prosecute non-natives who commit crimes on native land. If neither victim nor perpetrator are native, a county or state officer must make the arrest. If the perpetrator is non-native and the victim an enrolled member, only a federally-certified agent has that right. If the opposite is true, a tribal officer can make the arrest, but the case must still go to federal court. This quagmire creates a jurisdictional nightmare by choking up the legal process on reservations to such a degree, many criminals go unpunished indefinitely for serious crimes.",

Sallie Gardner is the name of the horse; the two jockeys were listed as being named \"C. Marvin\" and \"G. Domm.\" Neither of their identities are known, though they very well could have been black as Emerald claims. In those days many jockeys were black, such as thirteen of the fifteen jockeys racing at the first Kentucky Derby in 1875.",

I pull up in the line, and the boys go, 'Johnny Rico! Why didn't you tell us your dad was Johnny Rico?' And I said, 'What are you boys doing watching STARSHIP TROOPERS?' And they said, 'Our dads made us watch it with them!' Then my daughters get in the car, and my ten-year-old says, 'Dad, were you really naked in STARSHIP TROOPERS?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and she said, 'How could you do that to me?!' Then my eight-year-old says, 'Wait, like naked naked?' And I said 'Yup,' and she said, 'Oh my God, my life is ruined!' That was the longest three minute ride home I have had in my life.\"",

It realistically portrays both the routine aspects of running a control room during an event and then, of course, the tragic occurrence of the Black September attacks on the Israeli athletes. The control room is populated by ABC Sports President Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard), fledgling producer Geoffrey Mason (John Magaro), VP of Olympic Coverage Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), and German Interpreter Marianne Gebhardt (Leonie Benesch) who are all excellent in their roles. The film also accurately shows how technology that was considered cutting edge back then but looks amusingly primitive today (examples include giant VTR machines, competing for satellite space, manually inserting graphics, etc.). But the key aspect to any thriller is the writing and direction by Tim Fehlbaum who keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. Adding to the realism is the use of archival footage of Jim McKay's reporting of the tragedy. My only minor quibble is the casting of Benjamin Walker as Peter Jennings - he doesn't seem quite right to play the handsome and elegant anchor that I remember (I probably would have cut his character and only relied on the tape of Jennings talking from the Olympic village). But that quibble certainly doesn't stop me from highly recommending this excellent film - it is a must see!",

It feels less mass produced. So what was needed was a bit more work on the development of the characters, a bit more plot development. I acknowledge the criticism of another reviewer that the exposition feels a bit dogmatic, but davka (actually, for me) that is necessary for the precious little character development we do have here, so I wouldn't have edited that out. Rather, I'd have added to the run-time a bit, to flesh out all of the characters, precisely because, in a digital universe, personality and individuality begins to matter in this one.

Unlike the film, however, this did not assist them in recovering the aircraft. The root cause of the crash was found to be inadequate maintenance of the airplane's stabilizer \"jackscrew,\" which caused its threads to wear down excessively and eventually jam the jackscrew. While the pilots were trying to reach Los Angeles for an emergency landing, the threads were ripped out and the stabilizer moved to a position that forced the plane into its fatal dive.",

I don't know how anyone can make a movie and not rehearse. Even if you can't put it into the budget, figure out how to rehearse on weekends. That's what I preach because it just saves you so much time while shooting. You get to work out the kinks and bumps, and if the blocking doesn't quite work, or an actor's bumping on a line, or whatever. You have time to rewrite it, you can rework it with them. Also, we rehearsed with my DP (Menno Mans), so we were changing the shot list, we were finding better, more exciting ways to shoot a scene. So, by the time we got to shooting, on the day we could just fly... I think that I wouldn't be able to sleep the night before if I didn't know exactly what I was doing that day. (Laughs) I don't know how people do it. I mean, yeah, some people get off on that kind of spontaneity, but the thing is, something unexpected will always come up in filmmaking. It's like, no matter how much you prepare, too, no matter how much you rehearse, something unexpected will always come up. I think that that's the beauty of filmmaking. But for me, at least, when you're prepared ahead of time, you know exactly what you're doing coming in, then you can make those pivots very quickly because you've done all the work, and you've done all the prep.\"",

Unfortunately, the film is a bit like a taxi that keeps circling the block without ever quite reaching its destination.The plot centers around Anne (Synnøve Karlsen) and Patrick (Luke Norris), an estranged couple who, during a night out, find themselves at the mercy of a seemingly genial cab driver played by Nick Frost. As the evening takes an unnerving turn, the couple realizes they've been abducted and trapped on a remote, haunted road where the lines between the driver's dark motives and supernatural elements blur. What follows is a mix of psychological tension and paranormal confusion that leaves both the characters and audience guessing.Frost's portrayal of the cab driver is one of the movie's biggest draws. Fans of his unique blend of humor and menace will appreciate his commitment to the role. He brings his usual wit while trying to wrap it in dread that spices up the film's first half, though his character never quite reaches its full potential. Despite Frost's best efforts, the script holds him back from transcending into the truly chilling villain the story needs. His performance wavers between sinister charm and overplayed ambiguity, resulting in a character that feels like a missed opportunity for horror greatness.Goggins' direction is atmospheric, particularly in the way he captures the claustrophobic, isolated road setting, utilizing fog-drenched landscapes and eerie silences to ramp up suspense. However, this careful crafting is somewhat undercut by a plot that cannot decide whether it wants to be a paranormal ghost story or a gritty tale of abduction and human depravity. The film oscillates between these two horror subgenres without committing to either, leaving viewers with a sense of narrative whiplash.The pacing suffers as a result, with the first half filled with promise and taut, well-measured suspense, while the second half devolves into a somewhat chaotic scramble of revelations that don't fully deliver. I found myself nodding off at times, because there is just a lot of driving down a dark road throughout the film.In the end, \"Black Cab\" is a film that will intrigue those who enjoy layered suspense and are fans of Nick Frost's distinctive approach to dark roles. Certainly an ok one time watch.",

It was surreal, because they would bus you in in the middle of the night, so you couldn't see any of the country. They would just drop you in this resort compound, which was in fact surrounded by a razor-wire fence. You couldn't leave, much like in the film, and there was a kind of fake town where you could go shopping. The Chinese restaurant and the horrible discotheque in the movie are both based on that actual resort; the scene with the man on the ATV on the beach being chased by guards actually happened. And then, at the end of the week, they bused you back during the day, and you could see the actual immediate surrounding country, which was very poverty-stricken. There were people living in shacks. That contrast was obviously horrible, but also surreal, because you realized you had never actually entered the country; you were just dropped into this strange pocket of a sort of alternate dimension that had just grown up to become this tacky Disneyland mirror image of reality.\"",

Tim Roth hasn't done a decent film in almost a decade and is pretty embarrassing in this. The less said about Abigail Breslin, the better. She is a disaster.This is probably the only film you'll see which has a sniper sequence where the sniper 'hides' in a pool of light. The chief bad guy is pretty funny with his massive GPS screen somehow tracking Eckhart's every move until the plot requires \"he must be somewhere that hasn't got a good GPS signal\".The action scenes are boring; John Wick lite.I have to give him some credit though. Roel Reine did a good job with the cinematography and the soundtrack.",

The Brooklyn newsboy who got the nickel thought it felt too light. He dropped the nickel on the sidewalk, and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm with a coded message inside. After Hayhanen's blunders, Abel lost confidence in him and sent him back to the U.S.S.R., which would not have gone well for Hayhanen, who defected in 1957. He showed the FBI how to crack the code and it was Hayhanen who gave up Rudolf Abel. The \"Hollow Nickel Case\" was also dramatized in The FBI Story (1959).",

The project was officially announced in January 2021, but filming was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was scheduled to start in April 2022. In the meantime, Bonello directed the film Coma (2022) instead, which featured Ulliel in the last movie he filmed and the last work he finished. Ulliel passed away on January 19, 2022 following a skiing accident, and the filming for 'The Beast' was delayed again. In February 2022, Bonello told Variety that he would likely recast Ulliel's role with a non-French actor. On May 16, 2022, it was announced that British actor George MacKay was cast as the male lead and that filming was scheduled to start in August 2022.",

They would contract a big-name movie star to appear in their movie for one day, for a few frontal shots only, while the rest of the scenes were done with a double filmed from the back. A picture of the big star would then be placed prominently on the movie's poster in order to boost sales. (Example: Bruce Willis' character of Lieutenant Muldoon is never in the same frame with the other actors, indicating that all of his scenes were filmed separately.) Ironically, many of Willis's later appearances in films (especially during the 2020s), such as Corrective Measures (2022) were authentic versions of this, where Willis essentially played a small part in limited scenes but was billed prominently for marketing purposes.",

He was also considered for Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but turned it down again, still feeling he was too young. He was considered again for the role in For Your Eyes Only (1981), when for a while, it was unclear whether Sir Roger Moore would return. However, Dalton declined at that time, as there was no script (or even first draft). Dalton was offered the role again in 1983 for Octopussy (1983), and yet again in 1985 for A View to a Kill (1985), but had to decline the role both times due to previous commitments.",

Worth wore parachutes concealed within their suits. The \"parachute\" over which they fight is actually a dummy chute, which had to be removed before the stuntman could use the real parachute underneath. Stuntman Jake Lombard would don and remove the dummy chute up to three times in a single jump. The actual parachutes used by the stuntmen had a main and reserve chute concealed within the suitcoats. A breakaway seam ran down the back, which allowed the parachute to be opened without the need to remove the coat. There were only sixty to seventy seconds of free fall time, between when the stunt performers exited the aircraft and when they had to activate their chutes. After factoring in the time needed to get the performers and cameraman into position after leaving their plane, only a few seconds of film could be shot per jump. Therefore, the entire sequence required eighty-eight jumps, and five weeks to film, just to produce the two minutes of footage in the final movie.",

While there is great cinematography and some great effects, the main antagonist has this laughably gross look that detracts more than it gives, especially during some of the more significant scenes. The bits of blood are at least done well enough and there is some polish to how scenes look. Night scenes almost have that sense of terror, with some selectively great suspense-building shots and just enough lighting to see what's going on, except again the laughably comical looking antagonist.Acting is more miss than hit. Performances across the board were wooden, with only a few moments of true acting range during heightened tensions. I wish there was more to say here..... The story is, likewise, barebones and all-too-familiar. Once the bits of backstory come about, you've already guessed most of it and the rest is far too easy to predict..... The soundtrack is a bit too repetitive as well, with far too many similar sounding compositions popping up. Sound effects are only around for specific bits and don't add anything to the scene either.If you really, really, want to watch a movie with a laughably bad looking antagonist, then I guess Amelia's Children would be the one to watch. Otherwise there isn't much going for it, aside from some great visuals.",

Everyone's standing around and watching.' It is technical, but there is something about being naked with a member of the opposite sex that you still want them to think that you're hot. There's a reason why people are always having affairs with their leading men. With Gina it was really relaxing, because you could say things to her that you wouldn't say to other people. Like, 'Can you put your hand on my thigh here so my butt doesn't look so big? Can you hold my breast up so it looks more plump and juicy?' You would never, ever say those things to a man. Between takes, I would say, 'Gina, there's a shoe sale at Barneys. If we finish early, we should go over to Barneys and shop for shoes!' So it was surprisingly unsexy, but then when you saw it on screen, I was blown away. Violet and Corky have chemistry. They have it in buckets.\" She then added \"We were a little bit worried because Dino De Laurentiis was a producer, and we were worried that after we finished shooting the scene, they would send it off to Italy and insert some breasts and buttocks shots. The Wachowskis said that was a concern of theirs, too, so they decided to shoot that love scene in one long, continuous shot. They said, 'That way he can't cut into it without it looking really obvious and intrusive. So the day we were supposed to shoot the love scene, it was a closed set. But there were monitors in the hallway, and everybody was clustered around the monitors watching. So the Wachowskis put the camera on a crane, and there were all these elements that they wanted to capture. They wanted to start out on a safe and get the side of my back, and they wanted to pan down to the toes, and they would be yelling through a megaphone, telling us what different parts were onscreen. They would yell, 'Toes!' and Gina would curl her toes like she was about to come. Then they would say, 'Hand!' and my hand was on her crotch, and I would kind of move my fingers a little bit. And then they would say, 'Face!' and it would be on Gina's face, and Gina would 'come.' So it was very, very technical, and we did eight takes.\"",

In addition to producing the creature effects, Cosmatos trusted Winston to direct the second unit action sequences. \"George Cosmatos always let us take the lead in how to shoot the creature,\" noted Landon. \"He was such a big-hearted person, he would throw up his hands, and say 'I don't know what I'm doing.' He'd just admit it and let us do what we knew how to do. We know what our characters can do and we know the best way to use them. We're thinking about what our characters are going to have to do on the set the entire time we're building them. So we are goldmines of information and knowledge. Some directors recognize that, and really rely on us.\"",

I was drawn to the idea of how it would feel stepping into scene after scene having no idea what was gonna be thrown at me. I've never taken on anything like that and it was both challenging and exhilarating.

The only unusual thing about it is the fact that some big-name critics went nuts for the project, saying it was the best thing they had ever seen. Not really. But it does hold the attention.

Billy Wilder later recalled a day that was set aside just for shooting reaction shots of the jury and courtroom crowd (composed of extras hired only for the day). Normally, the assistant director would read the actors' lines, and the extras would react. However, Laughton, who was fascinated with the whole process of filmmaking, begged to help. So he came in on his day off and read all of the off-camera speeches to the jury members. He not only read his part but also the judge's, the prosecutor's, and even Marlene Dietrich's. According to biographer Maurice Zolotow in his book \"Billy Wilder in Hollywood\", \"it was an exhibition of craftsmanship such as Wilder had never seen. He believes that Charles Laughton had the greatest technical range and power of any actor, man or woman, whom he has known.\"",

Daniel Hanna, the movie follows Chris (Brendan Bradley), a separated new father, creating an account on a dating app and finding himself lured by a mysterious girl he matched with named Adra (Rachel Cook).Succubus is a movie that has a decent beginning where what is seen is mostly through the screen as the protagonist is video calling with his best friend while swiping right on the dating app. You can feel where the story is heading as he comes across Rachel Cook's profile. A profile that screams scam in every single way where to proceed would require a suspension of logic and sense, but nonetheless she is real, and from then on strange things start to happen. Brendan Bradley is good playing the struggling father, and Ron Perlman as Dr. Orion Zephyr is definitely a strong presence on the film. However, the story loses its steam in the second half where the turn of events departs from what came before and goes for the paranormal. It is one of those cases where it probably would have worked better if the story never left the initial setting and the realm of the real.It could be said the movie is an allegory for monogamy since many times the decisions the protagonist takes, ultimately putting himself in danger, are always related to finding the fulfillment of desire outside matrimony. It would seem Succubus is preaching that pleasure should only be sought between monogamous normative relationships, and everything outside its realms is deemed a one-way path to doomland. In any case, it is a movie with a good idea that sadly was not translated to the screen.",

The action sequences were top notch and it definitely delivered on the expected bloodbath.The surprise was the nuanced script (kudos again to Ms Orlan who co-wrote alongside her director Michael Ojeda), which delivers complex relationships between the sprays of bullets. And there are a lot of bullets... lotsa lotsa bullets. And blood. Lotsa blood. Like a bath-worth of blood.

In September 2018, it was announced that Michael B. Jordan would be playing John Clark in a two-part film series, which will be composed of 'Without Remorse' and 'Rainbow Six'.

He was finally arrested in June 1989 in Virginia, after the story of his murders was featured on an episode of America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back (1988); a former neighbor had recognized the age-progressed clay bust of List, which turned out to bear a close resemblance to his actual appearance, and alerted the authorities. List died in prison in 2008.",

The last twenty minutes felt rushed and I think it would have worked better as a mini series. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this dystopian take on social media and glad it's not a stereotypical Bollywood film.The direction was ace. The Cinematography was cool and the editing was pacy.This was a haunting depiction of the social media space as we see it today. I look forward to more such films in this genre in the future.",

All the scenes inside the theatre have a real gothic feel to them and were obviously inspired by Argento and the giallo movement in Italy in the 60's and 70's.On a mixed note, I did speak to a few people after the movie was over and they were a little vague about what was going on.

He had it shipped to UCLA Film and Television Archive where, with financial help from Muller's own organization, the Film Noir Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Charitable Trust, the film was preserved for future generations. This is one of Muller's favorite noir films for a number of reasons, including the pairing of two great actors, Ann Sheridan and Dennis O'Keefe , who wrote their own dialogue, but mostly because of its use of San Francisco, Eddie's home town, while it was still a bustling, growing, blue-collar seaport.",

Huge parts of the plot were left out and even one character's sexuality of being gay was cut out by the studio.It's possible that this 71-minute version of the film was an R-rated version which some producers wanted. Despite Kusama's objections, alternate scenes were filmed which for example showed more bloodier fights and bullet hits, and more nudity from Charlize Theron in several of her scenes. In the end, they decided to go with PG-13 rating so violence and nude scenes were cut, including an entire sex scene, although you can still see several quick shots of Theron's breasts in post-sex scene.Kusama's original cut was about 30 minutes longer and it also had different score, composed by Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil, which was rejected by the producers and replaced with Graeme Revell's score while they were re-editing different versions of the film for test screenings. Trailers for the film show some of alternate scenes which could be from Kusama's director's cut, like Æon in different clothes after she wakes up.",

This was an opportunity for me to make a film like that. I've done thrillers before, but this was the first time it involved this cat-and-mouse aspect to it. I was really intrigued by the family dynamic, the daughters, the nature of grief, this doctor who's essentially someone that's composed and tries not to panic, found himself doing just that,\" Elba tells Complex about the survival thriller directed by Baltasar Kormákur. \"I just love the script. I love Baltasar, the director. I wanted to work with him. He's made some really incredible survivor movies, and I just wanted to get his take on what this might be like.\"",

Lucky Bhaskar, Money Hist is well seen with comparisons in the Movies Series.When it comes to the story, Satyadev is a bank employee. His girlfriend Swati is also a bank employee. One day, due to Swati typing wrongly in the customer details system in her bank, the money that went to one goes to others. Then Pandu (Satyadev) solves the problem because he is a bank employee. He finds the existing loop holes and solves the problem by making the money return. How he dealt with those problems should be seen on the screen.But the screenplay is a bit confusing so it is not connected to the common people. Because the old story has to be told in a new way. The money heist scene in the movie is good, but the drama in the middle is not so good. The duration is a bit long, so the audience has to be patient. The rest is good.Satya Deva has acted very well. It is a different character for him. He is also a hero who looks like a villain of Dali Dhanunjay. He has also done well. Priya Bavani Shankar has done well as far as he is ok. In this movie he has done a good relief in the character of Satya. All the other characters are good in their range Acted. Overall Movie good watch theaters.",

It was considered the most brutal of the Australian colonies, known as 'hell on earth' through the western world at the time. Repeat offenders were sent there; the rapists, murderers, hardened criminals. And severe punishments were devised for them to strike fear in the hearts of those back in Britain, to deter them from crime. Women on the other hand, who'd often committed minor crimes, were sent to Tasmania to even the gender balance. They were outnumbered eight to one. You can imagine what kind of an environment that would set up for women. It was not a good place or time for them. And in terms of the Aboriginal invasion, what happened in Tasmania is often considered the worst attempted annihilation by the British of the Aboriginal people and everything they hold dear.\"",

The Pendleton was a T2 style tanker that, as with other \"liberty ships,\" was built in haste during the Second World War to support the Allies in Britain. The limited building facilities resulting from the rush of shipbuilding resulted in the T2 ships being built in two sections (bow and stern) and later joined at the middle. They had a known issue in that they tended to break in half when facing the combination of cold seas and extreme weather.\nBy insisting on maintaining 7 knots, the captain was hoping to reach a port as quickly as possible, in order to limit the amount of stress on the ship and to avoid metal fatigue that might lead to a break-up. He was balancing the threat of a broken weld versus breaking the ship in two. If he had complied with the engineer's request and dropped to 3 knots, the break-up would have happened anyway, but farther out to sea.\nIt is likely that, while losing his life and that of the other seven crewmen in the bow, his decision made it possible for the lives of the other half to be saved. In contrast to what has been reported elsewhere, the broken weld had little to do with the ship being broken in half. Rather, the weld broke due to the same strain that caused the ship to break in half.",

After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being \"silly,\" and the church was \"beautiful.\" Nicolas Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life in terms of what the characters would actually say to each other, and that the scripted version was \"overwritten,\" so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.",

The five-man team were allegedly given the contract on Hoffa by Tony Provenzano, a captain in the Genovese crime family. Kuklinski claimed to have been paid $40,000 for the hit. Kuklinski said that he knocked Hoffa unconscious with a blackjack and, while holding Hoffa's chin up, thrust a hunting knife into the back of his head. Hoffa's body was then allegedly placed in the trunk of a car that was then crushed and sold as scrap metal to Japanese car makers. The claims only surfaced after Kuklinski's death in March 2006 in a book by author Philip Carlo and will probably never be substantiated.",

I looked up that it had a limited theatrical release, but it's not theater-worthy in my eyes.I also found the story to be mostly predictable. Maybe I watch too many movies. I think others will enjoy this much more if they don't see everything coming. But you're probably better off rewatching a great movie instead. (1 viewing, 4/8/2023)",

Schumacher agreed. Then out of the blue, Nicolas Cage's agent called Schumacher and told him that he wanted to do the film as well. Schumacher then contacted John Calley at Sony and told him that we can do the film with Crowe as a \"low budget, dirty handheld camera thriller\" or a much bigger film with Cage. Calley then agreed to do the film with Cage as the lead which eventually led to a much bigger budget. Schumacher realized Cage was right for the part when Cage reportedly told him, \"I want to play a role I can internalize instead of my normal Schtick.\"",

Twenty years later the novel was filmed with some changes: the daughter became his wife, Claxxon became the Nakatomi Corporation, Joe Leland's name was changed to John McClane, and the film was released under the title Die Hard (1988). Because of a clause in Sinatra's contract for \"The Detective,\" which gave him the right to reprise his role in a sequel, he was actually the first person offered the McClane role even though he was 73 years old at the time. Also, coincidentally, Bruce Willis (who played McClane) made his movie debut in The First Deadly Sin (1980), walking out of a bar as Sinatra walked in. Additionally, Lloyd Bochner played Dr. Wendell Roberts in this movie. His son, Hart Bochner, played Harry Ellis in Die Hard (1988).

Suspicion grows even more rapidly as tourists and other internet surfers place someone who looks like Harri at the scene, and a horrifying night of cat-and-mouse survival ensues for Harri.Firstly, great idea, especially given the last 20 or so years of 'brown person bad' xenophobia and racial hatred towards anyone who looks Middle Eastern - the plausability and unfortunate relatability is well constructed in this film! The acting, flow, and overall tone of the piece are well done, particularly in the third act, when the plot comes to a head; Harri is not Superman and he actions seem desperate and real enough to believe.Definitely worth a watch!",

Of these regiments the only one that had any sergeant with the name of either \"Peter\" or \"Gordon\" was the 1st Louisiana Engineers. There were three: Peter Jones of company M, who deserted June 19, 1863; William Gordon of company A, who died of scurvy Sept 11, 1864; and Peter Simms of company I, who completed his 3-year enlistment and mustered out of service with the 97th USCT on April 6, 1866 as part of the occupation force in Mobile, Alabama. As a coincidence, there were also three \"Will Smiths\" in the 97th USCT; one of them enlisted in April of 1863 and would also rise to the rank of sergeant.",

What was really upsetting, was that it was making a story out of a tragedy.\" Maggie Denaro, the widow of one of the dead S.A.S. men said of Fiennes, \"It's time he grew up. He's made his money out of the book. He should come clean. When the book came out saying Mike had been murdered, we knew it wasn't true. But that didn't stop our children from being upset when other people believed it.\" Although Fiennes claims he sent a manuscript of the book to the S.A.S. and the families of the dead men, who gave their approval, they have all unequivocally denied his claim.",

William Finley was worried about whether the machine would be safe, and the crew assured him it was. The press was fitted with foam pads (which resemble the casting molds in the press) and there were chocks put in the center to stop it from closing completely. However, the machine was powerful enough to crush the chocks that it gradually kept closing. It is commonly believed that Finley pulled his head out of the press just in time to avoid being injured, and that his scream in that scene was genuine, but this is an exaggeration. Finley was quickly pulled out by grips and the record press scene, along with most scenes in the movie with little dialogue, was filmed without sound, and the talking and sound effects were dubbed in later. At a Phantom of the Paradise convention, Finley exaggerated the story and said that his scream was \"for real\", although he may have meant that he was able to conjure up a very real scream in post-production by thinking back to his memories of the incident.",

There was no Central Committee comprised of Communist Party and KGB men above the two (this was a plot device created for the film to show Soviet bureaucratic methods) and the main reason why the case took so long was that the investigators interviewed over 150,000 people trying to narrow down who the killer could be.

The original script was discarded and there were at least seven subsequent rewrites. Pitt said the final version was \"a mess\". \"The script that I had loved was gone,\" he said. \"I guess people just had different visions and you can't argue with that. But then I wanted out and the studio head said, 'All right, we'll let you out, but it'll be $63 million for starters.\" (Harrison Ford later noted that Pitt \"forgot for a moment that he was talking to someone whose job it was to write this s*** down\".)",

The visual narration has engrossed the audience to the screen forming a strong backdrop for progress of the story. The innocence and care by the fellow neighbourhood is evident through brilliant casting and sound screenplay.The first half leaves an eerie room for skepticm, anxiety in the viewers before the intermission. The latter half moves lethargically giving the audience an open pass for arriving at many story conclusions but leverages back on track with a surprising twist in the final 20 minutes leaving a lasting impression that reminds me of the phrase \"The tiger leaps two steps back not of fear,but to attack\". The tail end sequence will give answers to all the confusions and misinterpretations showing the deadly significance of 'Karma'.Splendid performance by Nazriya as the bold mischievous young lady marks the ideal response for her brilliance in script selection and the time intervals in her filmography. Basil has effortlessly done the strange characterisation through his witty mannerisms and actions. Sidharth Bharathan has delivered a subtle performance as a nerdy doc. Impressive performances from Akhila Bhargavan,Pooja Mohanraj,Merin Mary Philip,Kottayam Ramesh,Deepak Parambol,Gopan Mangat,Manohari Joy & Jaya Kurup.Sookshma Darshini will be marked as the hottest golden feather in Happy Hours banner. Brilliant frames by Sharan Velayudhan added with Christo's hooking BGM's and Chaman's meticulous trimming has given an engaging experience. Srik Varier also deserves appreciation for the color effects and the darker tones lifting the mood of the story.A must theatre experience for a gripping and sound story narration with spellbound performances.",

When you're watching the movie, if you look at the part where I take the gun out of the purse, before I come out into the parking lot, I grab a sheet off the bed. We did this many times with the sheet, and it just wasn't working, so I said, 'Forget the sheet, I am leaving the sheet behind.' So that's how I ended up getting so much more nude. I said, 'Forget it, if you want this, I'm going to go balls to the walls and here it is.'\" She added \"Because, as an actor, I just felt a lot better forgetting the sheet. I felt like it was more real. I felt like I was in my reality. I was, like, 'I would not be worrying about this stupid sheet right now! I just want the tape back.'\"",

It's part of the racket we call show business.\" The Capone hoods, who appreciated the value of a scam, left the hotel placated.",

In it, a spiteful mother beheads her stepson and blames it on her daughter. She then cooks the corpse and feeds it to his husband, as the daughter picks up the bones from under the table and plants it under a juniper tree on the family's garden. A small bird appears from the grave, singing the song in question while picking a pair of new shoes, a gold chain and a mill stone, and then carries them to the house. The bird then gives the shoes to the daughter, the chain to the father and drops the stone on the stepmother, killing her. As she dies, the bird turns into a boy again and the story ends.

In \"DARD-Dorod\", he once again shows that there is no limit to improvement. The film presents Shakib Khan in a more refined and powerful avatar, solidifying his position as one of the greatest actors of our time. Watching him perform in \"DARD-Dorod\" left me in awe-it's undoubtedly one of his best performances to date. This film feels like a groundbreaking addition to Bangladeshi cinema.Today, I watched the highly anticipated movie \"DARD-Dorod\", which has brought a new dimension to Bangladeshi cinema. Psychological thrillers are rare in any industry, let alone in ours. But \"DARD-Dorod\" introduces this genre with a fresh perspective, exploring the concept of Celebrity Worship Syndrome (CWS)-a psychological disorder characterized by an obsessive fascination with celebrities.Among all the psychological thrillers I've seen, this is the only film that has tackled CWS as a central theme. It's a unique Genre & applied for the first in any Bangladeshi cinema (I think this is the first ever film with this theme), and it's executed successfully. If you enjoy Psychological Thriller films, you're likely to appreciate \"DARD-Dorod\".To truly grasp the film's purpose, you'll need to stay engaged until the very end, as the director masterfully unveils the motivations behind the characters step by step.What impressed me most was the stellar performance by our Megastar, Shakib Khan. His nuanced acting and expressive eyes make \"DARD-Dorod\" a memorable experience. His performance in the end scenes is so emotionally compelling that it will leave many in tears. This is the Shakib Khan we want to see more of-one who captivates the audience effortlessly.The chemistry between Shakib Khan and Sonal Chauhan was amazing; they felt perfectly in sync, despite being from different countries. Everyone will love this pairing, and both delivered flawless performances.Supporting cast members like Rahul Dev, Payel Sarkar, Alok Jain, and Rajesh Sharma also gave commendable performances. However, I expected a bit more from Payel Sarkar's character. New Bangladeshi actress Safa Marwa also appeared in the film, and she did a good job while adding a touch of glamour to the screen.The setting of the film primarily revolves around Varanasi, India. The cinematography and visuals were enjoyable, with excellent camera work and soothing color palettes. However, I felt the locations could have been utilized even more effectively to enhance the narrative depth.The background score was phenomenal, enhancing the emotional depth of each scene. The music during Shakib Khan's walk in the final sequence was especially captivating. The film features three songs, with \"Jism Mein Tere\" partially used as background music in certain scenes, which blended beautifully with the narrative.If I were to point out flaws, there are.....",

But they also made sure that it is very rooted and realistic with the 90s production design on point without making the audience pay too much attention to that. Technically this is very well made in all the departments. The choice of making it two cases for the two halves was a brave one but it seemed to have also worked. But the way so many recent films have been using this same kind of theme for crime is getting irritating for me. That's where the Ozler movie kind of subverted expectations at a certain point and made me glad even if it didn't really do anything great. Here, a lot of choices about character motivations, their hurdles and the image they were creating for them was very much like how something like CSI would do but without actually copying anything from there. That in itself had its positives and negatives but that was also kind of irritating for me at certain points. But among recent police movies where a team of them investigates this was pretty good and better than something like Kannur Squad.",

Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone, Julianne Moore and Diane Lane were offered the role, but they all passed on the opportunity. Marion Cotillard and Carice van Houten were also considered. Paul Verhoeven later revealed that when Isabelle Huppert heard of the plans to adapt the book, she called around to express her interest in the project; when she landed the lead role, she requested that Verhoeven be asked to direct. After producer Saïd Ben Saïd sent Verhoeven a copy of the book by Philippe Djian, his interest was immediately piqued, and fortunately, Verhoeven and Huppert were fans of each other's work and had wanted to work together for a long time, so his participation was quickly secured. It was then decided to relocate the shoot of Elle to France, since there would be no American lead and no American company was willing to produce such a controversial film. Verhoeven also claimed that most actresses who had previously been approached immediately turned down the part as soon as they had read the script, instead of waiting for a few days, which is standard practice. One of the actresses said that she felt uncomfortable because of things that had happened to her in the past, and another didn't give any reasons but just said \"certainly not\". Verhoeven also told The Guardian that the only American actress he thought would have been game was Jennifer Jason Leigh (with whom he worked in Flesh+Blood (1985)): \"She would have had absolutely no problem. She's extremely audacious. But she's an artistic presence and we were looking for names\". Although Huppert had difficulties relating to her character, Verhoeven was exceptionally pleased with her performance, stating that she brought things to the role beyond what was written in the script, and that it was her film from the beginning, since he had only joined the project much later on her insistence.",

The narrative with the help of subtitles was spell binding and all credit should go the director for creating world class cinema. Comparison with the English language movie \" 12 Angry men \" is natural and fair. Twelve male stage actors discuss a possible course of action after their female colleague complains of being molested by one of them while she was sleeping after their get together. Discussions among them continue for a long time with each putting forward his views and suggestions. At one point it is unanimously decided to expel the wrong doer but then unexpected developments take place.Director Anand Ekarshi does a superb job with some fine storytelling and keeps the tempo and suspense going. He is helped by a well knitted screenplay, some artistic cinematography and brisk editing. All actors have done exceedingly well and it is difficult to say who is the best among them. Definitely a movie with all round excellence which needs to be on your\" must watch\" list.",

Despite the rumors there never was any full frontal or lesbian scenes filmed with her. Reportedly, original cut was about 45 minutes longer than final version.

Carpenter tells that while they were filming, for example, a sound take, a neighbor would start mowing his lawn or start up a chainsaw until he was paid to stop. Some of the people even tried to break into the equipment trucks. The whole experience essentially soured Carpenter on living in the area, where several scenes of his earlier film \"The Fog (1980)\" were also filmed.",

Ferreras and Mestre were a diver couple who used to perform free diving across the world. In 2002 during a free dive in the Dominican Republic, Mestre drowned while surfacing from underwater, as her surfacing device malfunctioned. Following her death, the media strongly suggested Ferreras to be the perpetrator, as he might have interfered the device in order to kill her. He was even arrested for questioning, but was later released. In No Limit, Mestre and Ferreras' story is loosely adapted into a drama between estranged couple Pascal Gautier and Roxane Aubrey. In the film, Pascal is an abusive husband of Roxane who is jealous of her successful career in free diving, something he is not perfect at. The film strongly suggests at the finale that he sabotaged Roxane's breathing device that causes her to drown underwater while surfacing, similar to the death of Audrey Mestre in real life. At the end of the film, an obituary dedicated to Mestre is shown.Following the release of the film, Mestre's widower Ferreras filed a defamation lawsuit against Netflix for blaming him for Mestre's death, as the film claimed to be \"inspired by true events\". In response, director David M. Rosenthal said that the film was a work of fiction and had no similarities with real life whatsoever.",

Yes it went downhill but no, the movie wasn't wrecked as it wasn't already on some incredible high ground.I think with a bit of spit and polish and some better ideas in the last act, this could have been very good.

While the film does have a really strong premise, it most definetly loses its steam in the latter acts due to its lack of understanding of where to go. I really adored Paul Walter Hauser in this, but his character felt severly underwritten- it sorta seemed like he was many things for a long time and yet, he just turned out to be a normal pretty intelligent man. They kept alluding to something big was going to happen at the end with a twist, but it never comes, leaving an odd sour taste in my mouth as the credits rolled.

The principal \"real-life role\" in the movie is Ben Sliney, the FAA's National Operations Manager, who made the decision on 9/11 to shut down all air traffic operations in the United States. Sliney had just been promoted to the National Operations Manager position, and September 11, 2001 was his first day on the job. That explains the applause from the FAA flight monitors when he walks into the control center in Herndon, VA, at the beginning of the movie. Several officials who were with Sliney in the FAA control room on 9/11 play themselves, including Tobin Miller, Rich Sullivan, and Tony Smith. In the scenes at Newark Airport, several air traffic controllers who were in the Newark control tower on 9/11, and who witnessed the air attacks on the World Trade Center, play themselves. At the air traffic monitoring centers in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, the air traffic monitors are all played by real-life air traffic controllers, including several who were at these locations on 9/11, and who monitored the hijacked flights. At the Northeast Air Defense Command Center (NEADS) in Rome, NY, most of the military personnel are played by real-life military air traffic controllers, including several people, notably Major James Fox, who were at NEADS on 9/11. Also, on United Flight 93, the actors playing the pilots in the movie are real-life airline pilots, and the flight attendants are played by real-life flight attendants, some of whom work for United Airlines.",

Mine is one of the first (if not the first) written review so my question is: If this movie is so bad, why aren't people reviewing it instead of just rating it poorly?I think this film is really good. Not great, but really, really good. The entire cast, and I mean ALL the actors and actresses in Strangers did a great job. Jon Voight is superb as usual. The direction was spot on, the lighting, the sound, the sets, the scenery were all good. The locations were beautifully shot. This movie is a great exposé on how vulnerable people can be manipulated and taken advantage of. It displays the great danger and disadvantage in letting emotion overrule logic and reason.The trailer almost spoils the \"twist\" near the end of the film but it doesn't completely give away all of it. The ending was not what I would have preferred and the ending may or may not be what you prefer but this is a movie worth watching....and probably more than once.",

That's the last time I ever cared about a movie because I went to the press screening and it was like getting kicked in the stomach, seeing what is not there.

It deserves all the awards, especially for Carolina Yuste, the lead actress. There are plenty of opportunities for the movie to fall into cliche, hyperbole or gratuitous sex/violence but it doesn't take the low road at any point. The characters are nuanced and the tension is created though some great performances, an effective score and great directing. I don't know if the film will be available to watch in the UK/US but, if it is, it's worth seeing at the cinema.",

It's incredibly amateurish, as if a bunch of high school kids banded together with a phone as a camera and grabbed a few random guys from the local diner to goof around and call it a movie. There is hardly any story, the acting is basically non existent, dialogues and the script in general are extremely simplistic. The pacing is totally off, at least half of the very short runtime is spent with a slow build, with very little payoff in the end.

In fact, he even remained in character up to and including the premier, only answering to The Warrior. His tag team partner from WCW, Scotty Riggs, cashed in a favour with Bagwell who got him some minor stunt work on the film. Riggs had to be excused from his stunt duties as he had lost depth perception due to his prolonged use of an eye patch. In order to use the name \"The Warrior\" Marcus Bagwell attempted to convince the WCW wrestler The Warrior (formerly the Ultimate Warrior) to allow Bagwell to take over the name. He refused but Bagwell used it anyways. Bagwell had suggested to Sidaris that he have a larger role and even rewrote a 150 page draft of a new script. Sidaris rejected his script due to its lack of gratuitous shots of planes taking off and landing. Bagwell wrote the scripts for a prequel trilogy but Sidaris unfortunately was forced to retire due to diminishing health. At his eulogy it was stated that one of his biggest regrets was not working more with Marcus Bagwell.",

It includes vivid physical descriptions of the characters that often differ greatly from the actors' onscreen appearance, as well as in-depth backstories for several characters, including secondary characters who receive little screen time. The book also leaves it a mystery until far later in the narrative as to what happened to Billy's parents, and also continues on past the movie's ending, wrapping up the stories of several characters whose fates are not addressed in the film's epilogue.",

According to The Hollywood Reporter, EuropaCorp's president, Luc Besson, wanted to shift the story's focus to the rescue mission rather than the politics behind the disaster. One theory is that nobody at EuropaCorp wanted to be hacked. \"Remember The Interview (2014)?\" a source said, referring to the Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen-directed comedy that angered Kim Jong-un and is believed to have sparked the infamous Sony hack in 2014. Ironically, the Russian leader is sympathetically portrayed in the original Kursk script, which highlighted why he took the tragedy personally (Putin's father was a submariner).",

Larry Gordon [Lawrence Gordon] had a terrible script set in a prison. Stallone calls James Woods and asks if I'm any good as a director. Woods says yeah, he's a good director and you ought to work with him. So we have a director and a star, but no script. All we have is a theme - a guy escaping from prison. So we hire Jeb Stuart, who was then one of the hottest writers in Hollywood, to rewrite the script and we go off looking for prison locations. Now we have a star, a theme, a shooting date, a budget, a studio, but we still have no script. So we all go back to New York City, and move into a hotel where Larry 'tortures' Jeb and Henry Rosenbaum into writing a script in record time. Meanwhile, I'm going around scouting prisons. We finally found one in Rahway, New Jersey. Jeb and Henry were writing the script as we were making the movie. New pages would come in every day. There was one day when I was on the third tier of a cell-block in Rahway Penitentiary and I had nothing to shoot. I had my movie star, all these extras and a great location - and the pages were on their way. So we sat around and bullshitted with the prisoners. Stallone is a smart guy and a very underrated actor. If I ever needed a better line, he'd come up with one. Stallone is a really hard worker. I had no problem whatsoever with him\".",

About 2.5 hours of footage divided into 250 segments was shot for the episode, with over a trillion unique permutations of the story (though many of those will be very similar).

As much as we might enjoy seeing Fabian Arnold running around shirtless and (very briefly) kissing another hunky guy, that doesn't make for an actual gay thriller.

This element was meant to underline the story of Frank (Oliver Smith) and Julia (Clare Higgins) and their corruption by lust, with the latter intended to become the ultimate villain of the series, but Pinhead proved much more popular with audiences, and thus became the center point in further sequels.",

John had the rights to Fortress and Arnold was going to do it. For some reason, I'm not sure why, Arnold finally decided that he wasn't going to do the movie and dropped out. They had a big budget, probably like 60 million, 70 million dollars, which was a huge budget in those days. Now it sounds small. [laughs] Anyway, he dropped out and the budget went down.

What will you show next? And then the filmmaker would have to outdo himself by showing more. So there was this escalation of violence and sensuality. After my generation, you know what happened? The sexy films became movies with penetration. I don't do that stuff, mine is just simulated. After that, they have to outdo themselves. The filmmakers, the producers and the move-going public wanted to see more. So they have to discover even younger actresses in the street, discover lesser stars, and the actresses became like toilet paper. That's how they (the producers) described them - tissue paper. Use them once and then throw them away. Use them for one to two films - they haven't even recovered money yet to buy themselves a car, and they are already out of the industry. And then they'll get a fresher face, younger. So my contemporaries were a decade younger than me. Because I was in my mid twenties when I was doing the sexy films, and the other films, the lead star is fifteen years old! You know, I was a middle aged woman, and my span of being a sexy star was up to one decade. I was in the industry so long, and there was a huge turnover of actresses. I outlasted them. But I told you, I have a supporting cast who will do all of the worst scenes. And since I'm the blockbuster drawer, I'm the crowd drawer in the film, they capitalize on my name, they listen to my ground rules.\"",

When Rock Hudson was approached to do the film he said he would only do it if his long time friend Taylor could also be cast. The producers had assumed that Taylor's salary demands would put the film well over budget and were lining up Donald Pleasence as a possible alternative to Hudson. However, Hudson said that he could get Taylor to agree to star with him for the same salary he was being offered. Hudson convinced Taylor that coming to England for a few weeks to do a mainstream film with him, Lansbury and Tony Curtis (people Taylor had known for about 30 years) would be beneficial for her mental health plus give her a chance to catch up with old friends who lived there.",

The cast is usual Slovak actors. Positive point goes to the absence of Rytmus in the movie. So no objections here. However - seeing the half-bakedness of the ending was expected, and left me dissatisfied. How come the ending is such abrupt, without any explanation, without any cliffhanger, without any wow effect? Just like that - bam, end of story.Imagine a foreigner seeing this movie, not knowing about the history of our criminal groups? I would gladly welcome at least a disclaimer about Cernak gang?When will slovak screenwriters understand that a story requires a climax and a resolution? When will they start writing stories for the audience, and not for their urge to self-express?",

There's a moment when she looks and sees bats going into the tree and you could think that maybe there's something in there, in the same way that bats were apparently the reason that COVID-19 kicked in. There are little references like that but image of a single tree in this sort of muddy little swamp to me was really creepy and intriguing and asks a lot of questions. There are little subtle things like there's a moment in the beginning when you see a picture from the people who lived in this house like a hundred years ago and it's the same tree but that tree is in blossom and alive, so it's died over the years and maybe it's become this kind of place where bad stuff lives. I would like to keep a little mystery in the story. I think the best kind of horror lives in between spots and it's not overly explained because if you over explain the monster then the monster loses its power to scare you. We did at one point flirted with the idea of seeing something in there like seeing a humanoid shape but I just felt in the end it's more interesting to let the audience ask that question whether they have an answer to it or not. There had to be a kind of reason why this kid gets infected, some sort of explanation, but you don't want to go too far with that, at least in my mind. I think it's better to have a little ambiguity in the story.\"",

However, Hauer also said during interviews in later years that he actually didn't take his arguments with Stallone personally, and that the biggest problem during filming was that it was a very difficult movie to make. From his part, Stallone has expressed deep regret over his behavior in the 1980s during a 2014 interview, stating that the success of Rocky (1976) had made him \"insufferable\"; by his own admission, he \"abused power and was an authority on everything\", and wished that he \"could go back and punch myself in the face\".",

Steve Bond (or Shlomo Goldberg) seems convincing enough to me, amid the cheap light and image quality, as the camera work is not so rarely vivid and powerful. The sensuality switches from heat and cold, embracing both evenly deeply. The actress shines with that fragile and perverse innocence, dear to the 80s and 90s that failed to survive the rise of the macho heroin, whose sensuality is expressed into male features like combat abilities, rather than through her femininity. That femininity she expresses feels like a caress on the cheek. This kind of movies produced during that generation, despite their quality, seem to have kept their ability to portray feelings with a depth that can be as unsettling as it is charming. This Z-series movie is one of those kinds you'll remember.",

However, Hill clashed over his script with the studio, who cut the budget halfway through shooting. Furthermore, due to special effects house Digital Domain considering a partnership with MGM, production was supposed to get a discount on the special effects, but when that deal fell through, they had to pay for \"the full spa treatment\", and about half of the planned shots had to be scrapped. Hill also disagreed with MGN on their decision to screen his first cut without many of the effects shots for a test audience (which, as he predicted, was a disaster), and their refusal to allow for additional filming (which had to be done anyway after Hill walked out). In an interview years after the release, Hill said that his version was much darker, had a very different setup and that the ending was much different from the final cut. He also expressed strong dislike for the way the studio ruined the movie but said that James Spader did a great job with his role.",

            "storyline": "Following the death of Heather O'Rourke in February of 1988 after she finished her work on the film (April-June 1987), it was the decision of director Gary Sherman to temporarily shelve the project during its post-production phase. However, due to the amount of money that had already been spent, MGM insisted that the film be finished and released as scheduled for June of 1988 or they would find someone else to do it. Apparently, after the film was given a PG rating by the MPAA in November 1987, the studio had already decided to have Sherman re-shoot the ending with more graphic scenes, in order to \"up\" the rating to PG-13. Planning for this re-shoot began in December 1987 and continued into January 1988, but was temporarily put on hold when O'Rourke died Feb. 1. The re-shoot (which used a stand-in for Heather) eventually took place in March, and the film was then \"re-edited\" and given a PG-13 by the MPAA in April 1988. Director Sherman would later claim that no such \"re-shoot\" took place, instead insisting that Heather died before they could film the \"original ending\" and that the current ending using the body double was what they hastily threw together when forced to \"finish\" the film by MGM. However, he is contradicted by at least six other people who also worked on the film who confirmed that the original ending was in fact filmed before Heather died and that the re-shoot of the ending took place after her passing. These people include producer Barry Bernardi, actor Kipley Wentz, assistant editor Jeanne Bonansinga, composer Joe Renzetti, special effects makeup artist Doug Drexler and the man who provided the voice for the Rev. Kane, Corey Burton. His claims would ultimately be proven false by the Collector's Edition Blu-ray release by Scream Factory, where the original film elements and the missing footage were discovered in a vault for a 4K restoration, including the original ending which Sherman denied ever existed. This Blu-ray release, as of 2020, has since gone out of print.",

The script had several scenes of Hauer's character Burns establishing his natural leadership by reminding the other hunters to abide by his rules. Originally, the dinner scene would be the moment where he puts Busey's character Doc back in his place. However, on the day of rehearsals, Busey came up with a two-page monologue about his dog that he wanted to try out. Hauer felt that Busey was obviously trying to steal his scene away by not giving him a chance to intervene in his monologue. So during the actual filming, Hauer improvised a quick response to the story by calling it \"bullshit\", which greatly confused Busey. However, Busey's delivery so impressed the director and the other actors that his monologue was kept in the final film, and Hauer's retort wasn't used.",

It's not easy to convey the reserved emotions of a non-human entity, yet sometimes display more sensitivity than the human characters you play opposite. The rest of the cast offers very compelling performances with a wide range of intensity and intrigue. The dynamics of the married couple are already on thin ice, so wait until the droid Eve is added into the picture for fireworks to really explode! Kudos to writer/director Rich Mallery for putting together this timely, thought-provoking, and thoroughly fun and sexy movie. I really enjoyed it!",

Their move to Levittown was marked with racist harassment and mob violence, which required intervention by state authorities. Despite this, the Myerses continued to face harassment for nearly three months. This led to some of the residents being charged and served an injunction. The Myers family received national attention and support. The Myers family eventually moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1961 after William Myers accepted a job offer in Harrisburg. He later died in 1987 at age 65. Daisy Myers later wrote an autobiography in 2005 about the experience titled 'Sticks 'N Stones: The Myers Family in Levittown'. She worked as a school teacher for the York School District for over 30 years. She was called the \"Rosa Parks of the North\". She died in 2011 at age 86. The news interviews that appear on TV in the film are from the actual citizens. They come from a documentary called \"Crisis In Levittown, PA\" from 1957. It can be found on Youtube.",

By its very nature, sex needs thrusting. More specifically, one part of the body must be in some form of friction with another. This isn't a very romantic way of thinking about it, but then again the MPAA isn't a very romantic organization. Their job is to count thrusts, and then decide, depending on the number, who should see the film. Nice work if you can get it.\"",

The \"accident\" was reported by several flights flying over the scene. The field was first planted with 85 acres of corn which was then bulldozed to recreate the gouge that a crashing plane would have made. The adjoining cotton field was also purchased to make the crash appear bigger. 140 extras were employed for the scene along with 40 members of the Kern County and Bakersfield Fire Department. One of the town's main roads was closed for a week, and the local electricity company was persuaded to knock down several pylons and snarl up half a mile of electric cable to create a scene of almost total devastation. The crash site took a total of 10 days to prepare, and included throwing 600 suitcases and their contents (all items purchased from local thrift stores) liberally around the site. In total, the recreation cost $2 million.",

The mother had help from the psychiatrist . The farther was at the least unsympathetic.Or ... are we (i.e. The viewers of this movie) the monsters, because we make the assumptions about the intentions everyone had before things happened; good, bad or simply coincidences?!OK, bad things happen, but what actually happened?! Was it intentional and truly that horrifying?!I don't think so.I guess that's why this movie wasn't categorised as \"horror\".The gore is mild and not at all overly explicit.Anyway, the supernatural aspects are also very intriguing.There seems to be predestination, BUT there's not or was there?!Causality and synchrinosity intertwined?Anyway, for me there was much more to this story. It was mind bogling, entertaining and very interesting.Have fun watching this intriguing movie!The acting is excellent.This is the first movie I've watched that came from Mexico.

One reason was because of the constant studio interference that didn't allow Carpenter much creative freedom. Carpenter also called Chevy Chase \"a director's worst nightmare\" and \"nearly impossible to direct\", also saying the same about Daryl Hannah. According to Carpenter, Chase would complain non-stop about the film's tone and hated wearing the special effects, often prematurely removing his makeup and ruining hours of filming. At one point, Carpenter broke a clipboard in half over his knee in a fit of rage when Chase removed his makeup mid-take. Carpenter said that Chase and Hannah were \"immune to any punishment from the studio, and they knew it, so they walked over me and everyone else on set and essentially told us we'd be replaced if we had any problem with them...it was like working with your boss's snooty children who would tattle on you if you didn't bend to their every will.\" Despite this, Carpenter ended up bonding and seeking comfort in Sam Neill over the troubling production and the two became close friends, with Neill agreeing to work with Carpenter again on In the Mouth of Madness (1994).",

I did see some of his stuff and it didn't look particularly good plus he also had some sort of nervous breakdown or something. So anyway they stopped shooting and offered it to me. Unfortunately I had commitments, I had some commercials to shoot. But anyway I took it over with barely ten days of preparation - which shows. It doesn't become my picture, it's a bit inbetween . . . [actor Oliver Reed was] scary at first because he was always testing you all the time. Difficult but not as difficult as Klaus Kinski. Because Oliver [Reed] actually had a sense of humour. I was rather fond of him; he could be tricky but he was quite warm really. He just played games and was rather macho and so on. Klaus Kinski was very cold. The main problem with the film was that the two didn't get on and they fought like cats. Kinski of course is a fabulous film actor and he's good in the part, the part suits him very well. They were both well cast but it was a very unhappy film. I think Klaus was the problem but then Oliver spent half the movie just trying to rub him up, pulling his leg all the way. There were shouting matches because Oliver just wouldn't let up. None of this is about art. All the things that you're trying to concentrate on tend to slip. So it was not a happy period.\"",

Mankiewicz rewrote all of Yordan's dialogue, reshaped the script and finished it. The Screen Writers Guild ruled that Yordan receive sole story credit and that Yordan and Mankiewicz share credit for the screenplay. Mankiewicz refused to share credit for a screenplay he had basically written and so received no credit. The studio remade House of Strangers as a western in 1954 as Broken Lance and Yordan was given credit for the story and won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story.",

When asked why he wanted the policy, Morrow replied \"I have always had a premonition that I'll be killed in a helicopter crash!\" Of course, on July 23, 1982, Morrow was indeed killed, along with two children, when a helicopter was brought down by special effects explosions, right on top of them while they were filming Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983). Morrow was decapitated by the helicopter's main rotor, as was one of the children. The other child was crushed to death. Incidentally, famed stunt coordinator Gary McLarty, who was one of the passengers inside the helicopter that killed Morrow, also appears in this movie as a State Trooper.",

It was really the late-'90s/early-2000s ones that I went to see in movie theaters, a lot of them on opening day as they came out. There's definitely a spiritual sort of through-line between those films and ours, but in terms of the way THERE'S SOMEONE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE looks, I was just excited to be able to take a more classical approach to styling a movie. I'd never had the chance, or had the time or the money to be able to craft a film visually in the way we were able to do with this one. I worked a lot with the DP, Jeff Cutter, in terms of thinking about what lenses we were going to use, and what the look was going to be, and it was thrilling to be able to craft the movie in a way that spoke to solving the problems of this individual project, as opposed to feeling like I had to throw in specific visual references to these other films you're talking about.\"",

            "storyline": "Trapped Inn isn't just a doomsday thriller; it's a visceral, unrelenting wake-up call to humanity. Through its stark portrayal of a collapsing world, the film doesn't simply tell a story; it hurls us headfirst into a reality that feels uncomfortably close. The tension builds with every scene, delivering a narrative that serves as a grim warning: we're teetering on the edge, and the choices we make now might be our last. While the drama is undoubtedly heightened for cinematic effect, Trapped Inn speaks to a deeper truth. The world depicted is the culmination of humanity's \"nickel-and-diming\" its way to oblivion-a society so consumed by short-term gain and apathy that it has reached a critical crossroads. In this world, mediocrity and complacency have calcified into a collective paralysis, trapping everyone in a prison of their own making. The metaphorical inn becomes a reflection of this entrapment, a place where survival is overshadowed by the looming realization that there might be no way out. Director Leah Sturgis masterfully captures the harsh reality that tough individuals often refer to with a grim shrug: survival in this world is merciless, and salvation doesn't come gift-wrapped. The film's characters are pushed to their limits, forcing us to confront an uncomfortable truth-our savior may very well look like the person staring back at us in the mirror. Self-reliance and hard choices, the film suggests, are the only way forward. The performances are raw and haunting, with Matt Rife delivering a standout portrayal of a protagonist grappling with internal and external collapse. The cinematography mirrors the bleakness of the narrative, offering unflinching shots of desolation and decay that make the stakes feel all too real. Yes, Trapped Inn is dramatic, perhaps even melodramatic at times. But isn't that the point? It's a cautionary tale dressed in adrenaline-pumping, edge-of-your-seat storytelling. It implores us to look inward and ask hard questions about where we're headed. If we fail to act, if we continue to prioritize mediocrity over meaningful change, the film's dystopian vision could very well become our harsh reality. In the end, Trapped Inn doesn't just entertain; it challenges us to face the uncomfortable truth that saving ourselves might be the toughest battle of all.",

A few test scenes were shot before searching for financiers, which led Pyun to the Shah brothers at Imperial Entertainment. They agreed to bankroll the film on one condition: Alex had to be changed into an adult male and Olivier Gruner, their recent discovery, had to play him. Pyun agreed when the Shahs promised not to influence production in any other way. The concept of Alex being a woman was eventually used in the sequels, played by bodybuilder Sue Price.",

Ultimately, the record of this musical score was not only more successful than its initial release but came to be one of Morricone's bestselling work.\nThe music was used again in the 80s for a Royal Canin commercial (a dog food brand) featuring slow-motion running dogs, and this became so famous that most people now associate \"Chi Mai\" with the commercial. It was even spoofed in Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra (2002).\nWhen a national tribute for Belmondo was held right after his death in 2021 in the Hôtel des Invalides, \"Chi Mai\" was played.",

This happens when the air from the downwash of the propeller blades swirls up and cycles back down through the blades. In essence, the helicopter is descending through a downrush of air that cycles up back through the blades, which raises the pressure of the air passing over the top of the blades, thereby reducing lift. This was partly caused by the enclosing walls of the landing area that caused the air to hit the ground, be pushed towards the walls, then directed up the walls and sucked back into the blades. As the helicopter dropped, the tail hit the top of a wall and it began to roll, at which time the pilot put the nose down so that the helicopter would not roll over onto its side. It came to rest with the nose down at a 45º angle. The occupants sustained no serious injuries.",

Also, she said, she had not been warned about the graphic portrayal of Ponto's assassination when she was invited to the movie premiere and felt humiliated by the producers for making her sit through this without a warning. About a month later, she filed a lawsuit against the producers, who claimed that every scene is historically accurate, because the assassination of her husband, which she had to witness from the next room, was not portrayed as it happened. She demands the scene of the murder of her husband be cut from the movie. The filmmakers claim that they had tried to contact her during production to get the scene right but she had no desire to cooperate. Before this movie, there had been no portrayal of Ponto's assassination on film and she felt the staging of the movie was lurid and dishonoring to her husband. As of this writing, no decision has been reached about the lawsuit.",

The 3 main characters provide magnificent performances. The film has excellent pace and holds your interest. The sex scenes are extreme but necessary to tell the story. The end is very interesting. It seems to portray several potential outcomes (and this is not a spoiler) and leaves it up to the viewer to decide. I seldom rank films at 10 but this one is highly recommended.

Craven filmed this version of the film and Warner Bros. decided to screen it to a test audience mostly consisting of Craven's fans. The response from fans was negative, criticizing the lack of violence and gore seen in Craven's previous films. The studio eventually discovered Craven's popularity as a horror film director. The president of Warner Bros. at the time, Mark Canton, demanded Rubin write six additional gore scenes into his script, each bloodier than the last. Rubin worked very hard with Craven to create a very deep and heartfelt movie out of it. Unfortunately, added gore scenes, re-shoots and post production re-editing of the movie heavily changed the original story. Craven and Rubin expressed strong anger at the studio and thus disowned the film.",

            "storyline": "The 2024 film Butas sets out to delve into complex and emotional themes, yet struggles with execution and storytelling. The plot, centered on the lives of four young individuals in a boarding house, feels overly contrived and, at times, tiresome. Though the movie attempts to explore profound ideas like identity, vulnerability, and self-discovery, it fails to create a meaningful emotional connection with the audience, largely due to underdeveloped characters and a shallow storyline.One of the film's main weaknesses lies in the performances of its cast. While seasoned actors like Angela Morena and Albie Casiño play the lead roles, their portrayals feel unconvincing and flat. Instead of allowing characters to grow and evolve naturally, they fall into clichéd roles that don't inspire empathy or engagement from viewers.Directorially, Butas is similarly lackluster. Dado C. Lumibao's approach lacks the coherence and balance needed to transform the film's emotional themes into a compelling narrative. Some scenes drag unnecessarily, attempting to increase impact but instead slowing down the film's pace to an uncomfortable crawl.Moreover, the soundtrack does not complement the story's mood or setting. At points, it even adds an air of discordance to the film, disrupting immersion rather than enhancing it. This mismatch between music and visual scenes makes it harder for audiences to follow along with the intended emotional beats of the story.In summary, while Butas aims to tackle socially relevant and emotionally resonant topics, it falls short due to weak storytelling, superficial character development, and uneven directing. This leaves it as a middling film experience that struggles to captivate or resonate deeply with its viewers.",

During this time, several murders of women were committed by Ball, and the legend is that he would dispose of his victims' bodies by feeding them to his pet alligators, but it was never proven that the flesh found in the pit was human. Joe Ball committed suicide at his bar on September 24, 1938 when he was about to be arrested by the police in connection with the murders.",

There have been a few exceptions though with Revenge (2017), Nightbird (2023) and possibly even the remakes of I Spit and Last House.For this reason, I am happy to say (as an exploitation movie fan) that Sabel Is Still Young doesn't shy away from pushing the boundaries of good taste. From the titillation to the violence to the revenge, it's all here. And that's exactly what I wanted to see. At 135 minutes, every act of the movie has enough room to breathe and never feels rushed.Although there may be a few odd plot holes (like is Sabel with a wig so unrecognizable? Surely her tattoos should have given the game away), these can be easily overlooked.Overall, if you're a fan of the sub-genre and are tired of rewatching the classics, Sabel Is Still Young is a worthy successor.",

Abandoned by his parents at the age of six, he claimed he had roamed the countryside alone, witnessing rape, murder, and incest, constantly fearing for his life. Kosinski turned those stories into his first novel, \"The Painted Bird\" (1965), which, for a time, was considered a major work of Holocaust literature. Kosinski's autobiographic claims were later debunked when it was revealed that he and his parents had all been sheltered by religious Polish people who had never handed him over to the Nazis.",

He uses the essential elements of the book's plot but streamlines it to make it more meaningful, more powerful. (It is not often that a film takes the plot of a book and makes it better in its screen version.)Without sermonizing or taking sides, the films ask questions about society, justice, morality, parenthood, values, beliefs, entitlement . By testing the moral strengths of the protagonists, the film makes the audience question their own mettle in limit situations.The imagery is strong enough, but not overwhelming to allow the viewers the personal space to make their own opinions. So is the acting - convincing, without going overboard.After Parasite, I think this is another homerun of the Korean cinema. I would strongly recommend it for viewing in film clubs in universities - our young generation need to see it.",

It was released in the European market, however Stanley has never seen this version. Stanley came to an agreement with the producers over a 95-minute compromise cut. At this point the film's British backers, Palace Pictures, went bust, making it increasingly unlikely that the film would ever see the light of day in a UK cinema. Then after about a year of frantic searching, Stanley discovered that the original negative was being held by PolyGram. He went to the film's original investors, Channel 4 and British Screen Finances, which were naturally keen to see what had happened to their investment. PolyGram was obliged to hand over the negative, which Stanley re-cut to his own specifications, and with his own money.",

The story centers on a talented cryptographer who finds himself caught in a high-stakes pursuit, striving to unravel a series of enigmatic messages with potentially significant consequences.The film boasts impressive visuals, featuring cinematography that effectively conveys both the tension of the storyline and the allure of its locations. Chen Sicheng's direction skillfully balances suspenseful moments with character development. The cast delivers strong performances, especially the lead Haoran Liu, who adds depth to a multifaceted character grappling with ethical challenges in a secretive environment.Despite its captivating premise, some viewers might perceive the pacing as inconsistent, particularly during the second act, where the narrative occasionally loses focus. Additionally, certain aspects of the plot may seem familiar to genre enthusiasts, lacking the fresh twists that could enhance the experience... and all that extended to over 2.5 hours!In summary, \"Decoded\" presents a compelling examination of its themes, bolstered by solid performances and high production quality. It is likely to attract thriller aficionados and those intrigued by the subtleties of cryptography, although it may not completely fulfill the expectations of those in search of an innovative storyline.",

After nearly three years search, in 2002, the film's editor Anthony Buckley tracked the film down to CBS' Iron Mountain archives in Pittsburgh, where an initial 60 cans of film were found in a shipping container marked \"For Destruction\". By September 2004, a further 263 cans - several of which contained the original camera negative - were recovered from the vaults, allowing for a full digital restoration.",

Assonitis, the film's producer and prolific film-maker. Assonitis had made a deal with a small label at Warner Bros. for a budget of $500,000 to produce the movie, provided that an American was credited as director. After considering Miller Drake as director but finding him unsuitable, he gave the job to Cameron after being impressed by his special effects on Galaxy of Terror (1981); but what he really wanted was a first-timer who he could easily side-step in order to take over as director, something he had already done on Beyond the Door (1974) and Madhouse (1981). According to \"Dreaming Aloud,\" a biography of James Cameron by Christopher Heard, and \"The Futurist\" by Rebecca Keegan, Cameron worked on the film's special effects, re-wrote the script, created storyboards, did location scouting and actually filmed for four days. However, Assonitis called most of the shots, continuously questioned Cameron's decisions, did not allow him to watch his own footage, and finally fired him on the fifth day of shooting, reportedly because Cameron's footage wouldn't cut together. Later, Cameron was able to convince Assonitis to show him a rough cut of the film, which was horrible, but not because there was anything wrong with his footage: Assonitis had simply manipulated the situation to re-write half the movie (adding nudity that wasn't in the script originally). Cameron then broke into the editing room every night for weeks, and cut his own version. Unfortunately, Assonitis found out and re-cut it again. The most widely distributed version of the film that is available on DVD is Assonitis' version, although Cameron was later allowed to create a director's cut that saw a limited release in some markets.",

In 1910, after reading in Mark 16:18 \"they shall take up serpents... and it shall not hurt them,\" former bootlegger George Went Hensley, aka \"Little George,\" took a rattlesnake box into the pulpit. He reached in and lifted out the venomous viper, showing his faith to take God at his Word. He then challenged his congregation to do the same. News spread throughout the hills of Grasshopper Valley in southeastern Tennessee. Before long, others joined in the handling of rattlers. The practice continued for ten years until one of the faithful died of a snakebite. Hensley moved to Harlan, Kentucky.",

They were stolen temporarily by Tester and Pierce, respectively, so that Agar could duplicate them, but it turned out that the Folkestone keys were not being used anyway. The guard's van was not locked from the outside; Pierce and Agar were let in by Burgess, and a share of the loot was handed out to Tester, at stations. None of the criminals were spotted at once; it was several months before the railway conceded that the crime must have occurred on the train. The details came to light after Agar had been convicted in an unrelated crime, and his accomplices decided to steal his share instead of using it, as he had asked, to provide his mistress an income. She got word to him, and he turned Queen's Evidence against the others, and told all. At no point in the case, did anyone escape from custody.",

Tamborra joked many years later that he wished he could have filmed that scene. But his parents wouldn't even let him see the film until he turned 15.",

On the other hand the story wasn't at its best it gave me the idea of being a bit poor. The conclusion in the end comes very simply, it would have been good a little more suspense.I would have preferred more research into the characters by the director.Overall it's not a masterpiece but if you have nothing else to watch if you like slightly \"particular\" thrillers it's not to be ignored.",

The Big Pool was 88 meters wide and 72 meters long. It was given one final performance when it was last used for this film on September 7th and was demolished on October 13th. Toho's decision to destroy the pool was due to \"progress of special-effects technology such as CG, and a large-scale reconstruction plan of the studio.\" This was considered by many to be the end of an era.",

Any movie they do now will be compared to that movie.There are some common elements, but Neru is a totally different movie, both the theme and the mood of the movie. This is emotionally more draining than Drishyam, while it does not have the sheer audacity and shock value that Drishyam hadThe best part of the movie is the script. After 10 minutes or so, the movie just hooks you in, and you can't look away even for a minute, till the very last scene in the climax, which will most probably leave you teary eyed.Performances are top notch. Special mentions to Sidhique and Jagadish. Two actors who were doing Tier 2 comedy movies 30 years ago, but their acting careers are on a totally high trajectory.But this movie is carried by Mohanlal and then Anaswara Rajan. Yes, Mohanlal is one of the greatest actors in India and his performance is expected, but Anaswara matches him best for best. Their scene together in the first half and then in the climax will leave you spell boundOn the flip side, don't expect any out of the world movie making techniques. Technically the movie is just passable, but that is a typical Jeethu Joseph style. He let the script and performances take centre stage. The Cameraman, editor and music director just do their job in the back groundLast but not the least, spare a thought for the genius of Jeethu. Making one edge of the seat thriller like Drishyam is impossible for 9/10 writer directors. But he has now done 4 movies at that level (Drishyam 1 & 2, Memorie and Neru). Hats off man, and hope you outdo yourself in your next one.",

However, we must also take a look at the acting which is one of the few decent things in the film. And finally you also have to look at the ending which is really very rushed, that is, the film itself is very slow, then they get to the ending and I don't understand why but they feel like they're in a rush to finish it as soon as possible.",

Writer and director Derek Pike was simply keeping the movie afloat by using generic horror tropes and home invasion tropes that has been done and seen countless times in other movies. And on that account, then \"Model House\" just didn't bring anything new to the genre. Sure, it was a watchable horror movie, though it was a generic and rather forgettable one at that.The acting performances in the movie were good, and there were a couple of familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Cory Anne Roberts, Scout Taylor-Compton, Randy Wayne, Phillip Andre Botello and Ryan Merriman.Visually then \"Model House\" was okay. Nothing outstanding here in terms of special effects or gore.Watchable for what it was, \"Model House\" is a thriller movie that came and went. I doubt that I will ever return to watch it a second time.My rating of \"Model House\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

Whichever it was it went off the rails and copious amounts of sex was thrown in till neither the sex nor the plot had any meaning.A major reason for my assumption is the storyline which is intricate but inadequately executed. Such storylines are rarely written for erotica( the genre had already run its due course in the 80s & 90s), while the unexplained sex every few minutes adds no coherence to the plot.This is an fairly decent average budget flick that offers bountiful gratification which isnt hard core and provides some semblance of a storyline that may at best tickle your thinking.

The FIN asked for a disclaimer at the start of the movie, stating the film is fictional. The producer of the movie did not agree with adding such a statement (apart from the standard disclaimer at the end that parts of the story had been fictionalized for dramatic purposes), and the Dutch court finally decided an additional disclaimer was not necessary. Director Jim Taihuttu defended himself against the allegations, stating that the behavior and language of the soldiers was based on diaries given to him by an actual soldier in the war.

I'm not sure how said armor remained unrusted sitting in a box in a basement for 20 years, unoiled and unpolished, but nevermind that. I like the idea of someone pulling the St George routine in our modern era, and there was a lot that could have been done with this story had a better director and writer been in charge - maybe explore the family history, or better define what the monster-thing is. The acting could have been worse tbh, so there's that. But the whole story starts slow then slows down more and finally comes to a shuddering halt, all while accompanied by some of the worst cinematic music I've heard since the '80s. I rented this for $6 from Amazon Prime, and I feel like I should get at least $5 back. I really wouldn't waste either the time or money on this film if I were you.",

However, there was apparently poor communication with the advertising department, since when the movie came out, newspaper ads stated, \"based on the famous Leopold and Loeb murder case.\" Leopold sued the filmmakers. He did not claim libel, slander, nor anything false nor defamatory about the film. Instead, he claimed an invasion of privacy. The court rejected his claim, in part, because Leopold had already published his own autobiography \"Life Plus 99 Years,\" presenting essentially the same facts.",

If you thought the plot was going to be the worst part of this film, think again. Izabellah's dialogue delivery feels unnatural, like someone reading their lines off a script for the first time. At some points, it almost feels like she's speaking in an entirely different movie, entirely unaware of the tension or drama happening around her. Frankly, earplugs should be mandatory if you plan to sit through this film-her voice is truly traumatizing, and I'm not being dramatic.",

All the screenings of the first cut got very bad reactions, and the film was then shelved while re-shoots and story changes were being done. A new ending was also filmed in which the main villain is killed in a different way - but even after re-shoots and title changes (the movie's working titles were \"Detox\", \"The Outpost\" and \"Eye See You\"), Universal Studios didn't care for it. After test screenings for the new version also got negative response, it finally received a limited release three years after completion.In a Q&A for Ain't It Cool News in December 2006, Sylvester Stallone was asked why the movie didn't get a wider release, and he answered;\"It's very simple why D-TOX landed in limbo. A film is a very delicate creature. Any adverse publicity or internal shake-up can upset the perception of - and studio confidence in - a feature. For some unknown reason the original producer pulled out and right away the film was considered damaged goods; by the time we ended filming there was trouble brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the director and the studio. The studio let it sit on the shelf for many months and after over a year it was decided to do a re-shoot. We screened it, it tested okay, Ron Howard was involved with overseeing some of the post-production... but the movie had the smell of death about it. Actually, if you looked up, you could see celluloid buzzards circling as we lay there dying on the distributor's floor. One amusing note: It was funny, when we were met at the airport by the teamsters they'd have a sign in front of them saying DETOX, and all these actors like Kris Kristofferson, Tom Berenger and myself looked like we were going into rehab rather than a film shoot.\"",

            "storyline": "\"We Are Wolves\" sets out to be a psychological thriller drenched in tension and dark intrigue, but unfortunately, it falls short of its ambitions, delivering an experience that is more frustrating than captivating. The film tries to explore deep themes of power, control, and loyalty, but its execution is marred by a disjointed narrative, underdeveloped characters, and a reliance on shock value rather than substance. The premise holds promise: a protagonist returns to a household she once fled, only to be drawn back into a twisted web of dominance and manipulation. The tension between the characters-particularly Fenix, Selena, and Needles-should have been the film's driving force, but instead, their interactions feel repetitive and lack the emotional depth needed to make the audience care about their fates. The psychological games they play with each other could have been intriguing, but they quickly become tiresome, as the movie seems more interested in pushing boundaries than in telling a coherent story.Visually, the film has its moments. The eerie atmosphere and unsettling settings do help to create a sense of dread, but this is often undermined by pacing issues and scenes that drag on without adding meaningful development to the plot. The dialogue, too, oscillates between overly dramatic and painfully blunt, which detracts from the intended tension and leaves the characters feeling one-dimensional.One of the film's biggest shortcomings is its overreliance on shock value. While there are certainly disturbing moments, they often feel gratuitous and fail to serve the story in a meaningful way. Instead of building genuine suspense or exploring the psychological complexities of its characters, \"We Are Wolves\" seems content to shock the audience without offering much substance behind the shock.Ultimately, \"We Are Wolves\" is a movie that had potential but is let down by its execution. The dark themes and intense atmosphere are there, but they are buried under a script that fails to deliver on its promises. For viewers who enjoy dark, psychological tales, there may be some moments of interest, but they are few and far between. In the end, the film's inability to effectively develop its characters and story leaves it as a forgettable entry in the genre, one that fails to live up to its own ambitions. I gave it a 2,5/10 rating meaning skip this one preferably.",

            "storyline": "\"KA\" offers an interesting blend of predictability and creative storytelling. While the story itself may follow a somewhat expected path, the credit for elevating the experience largely goes to the screenplay writer. Despite a seemingly ordinary narrative and a screenplay that, at times, feels too familiar, the director introduces a fresh storytelling approach that salvages the experience-especially in the final 15 minutes, which provide a rewarding payoff for viewers willing to endure a somewhat sluggish two-hour buildup.Background music is a mixed bag; at times, it overwhelms the scenes with excessive \"bang,\" and some hero elevations and action sequences feel forced, detracting from the overall impact. Kiran Abbavaram's performance is inconsistent, with moments of poor acting that highlight missed opportunities for character depth and genuine connection. Comedy and songs, had they been executed more effectively, could have turned the movie into a major hit. Nonetheless, the film has found success and deserves commendation for its ambitious efforts.The village's unique setting, where the sun sets early and darkness brings forth horror, is intriguing and sets an eerie backdrop that enriches the film's atmosphere.Kudos to directors Sandeep and Sujeeth for pushing boundaries.

            "storyline": "After the death of his wife, a plant worker moves with his teenage daughter to a derelict mansion in a Muslim-majority suburb of Bangkok where his disrespect of several artifacts inadvertently unleashes a series of curses upon them and must try to make it right to stop the incidents from continuing.Overall, this one has quite a lot going for it. Among the main likable features here is the strong storyline that lets the film work in localized folklore and traditions as a building block for more straightforward supernatural antics. Operating within the confines of the country's history by exploring Thailand's uneasy cultural and social relationship with Malaysian citizens with the Muslim community conflicting mightily with the more traditional Buddhist methodology in place throughout the country is a wonderous way to work with here. Rather than just simply coming upon a series of ghosts or hallucinations and thinking it's all just inside his head, the downward spiral is instead given a historical context that easily explains everything happening to him and his relationship with those around him. When those aspects are brought up as a possible means for the nature of what's going on around him, this setup becomes more believable which helps to bring together the confines of the final half where it all makes sense. In addition, the film gets a lot right with its series of impressive and somewhat chilling hauntings. With the opening setup featuring a small hint of the resulting curse that affects others coming shortly, the gradual build-up of events once the action shifts to the present day is quite intriguing. Featuring the traditional series of setups including hallucinations of people or things that aren't there, shadows coming to life behind their knowledge, or whispers of demonic influence taking hold, these aspects are a major part of the middle segments here as the haunted house-style structure is in place. These lead up to the strong finale where the spectacle is ratcheted up a notch involving the influence of spectral beings, banishment rituals, a supernatural combat session, and a more focused energy that allows for a lot of action to take place at a time when it's warranted and necessary. This section also brings about the big importance of utilizing the Muslim culture for how the demonic beings interact and how the spiritual battles take place which adds a different flavor to these scenes. As a whole, these factors are enough to bring about a lot of fun for this one although there are some issues here that arise. One of the main detriments is a challenging and somewhat unnecessary running time that goes on way longer than it should. While we get plenty of build-up surrounding their strained relationship and the need to rebuild it as well as the inner workings of their being in the community, some of this goes on way too long and causes the pacing to drag and stutter to a halt as a result. Quite a bit of the repetitive nature of the neighbors' trying to instill their beliefs upon the two or welcome them into the community at work is capable of being trimmed, much like the flashback explaining the origins of the cursed property that plays out in a reenactment rather than just being served as a story told explaining what happened. Seeing the past featured as it does with the various figures responsible for cursing and countercursing the location is just exhaustive and draining when just a simple story about it would've made the film go by a little easier. Also, the need to include the secondary backstory involving his depression over his dead wife and the grief associated with that as the reasoning for his easy possession doesn't need to be there as the religious history of the house and surrounding areas was already enough to explain what was going on. Tacking this on feels like overkill at a time when it doesn't need anything extra added to it, and is what ends up holding the film back slightly.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence.",

This is the story of Maria, one woman who dreams of competing against her sister and now, the technology of robotics has come along way and it seems that bionics has made her dream possible for her at last. But, a few things still stand in her way. There is crime and adventure, and who knows what awaits her in this new world she is about to enter. The CGI looks very good, there are robot arms and legs which are convincing enough. The acting is mostly good but I did not feel the story as much as I like to. It did not capture my heart.",

When Franco screened the completed film to him, he was horrified by the quality. The shots were too blurry and no movie lighting was used, it was rough and raw. Franco defended the film and explained it was the style he was going for. Still dissatisfied, Dietrich told Franco it was a terrible film and wasn't sure if he would be able to sell it to theaters. However, much to Dietrich's surprise, he managed to sell it to numerous European cinemas and the film was a decent success at the box office and received several good reviews at the time. Many years later, in an interview, Dietrich thought more highly of the film and said it was the first film to use the Dogme 95 style before Lars von Trier. Franco went on to make 16 more films for Dietrich over a three year period, and he told Dietrich they were the best years of his life.",

The fans of Emile Hirsch will be happy as he was convincing playing his character. I like him as well. The story has a constant mysterious vibe so you keep wondering what is going on, what is the real truth, so yes it was entertaining. But in the end it's just okay, not a movie I will remember by next week. That's the reason I rate everything I watch, to make sure I don't rewatch a movie that I scored lower than a seven.",

Even Brian De Palma himself was very pleased with the results. So much so that when the film was going to be released on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory in 2016, De Palma was able to convince Shout! to hold off on their initial release so the Re-Cut could be included on the Blu-ray.

Shake hands with everybody and tell them I hated their movie?\" Koch disliked the movie's reference to themes like American violence and the stigma of mental illness. \"That 'didactical' tone, isn't it killing?\", Koch said.",

While Craven's death put the notion of returning to Hatchet in Green's mind, it was another of his heroes, George A. Romero, specifically telling him to make more Hatchet films for the fans, that solidified his decision to make a fourth Hatchet. Romero passed away just thirty-seven days before the surprise unveiling of this movie on August 22, 2017, and Green stated that this movie would not exist if not for Romero's pep talk assuring him that what he did as a filmmaker mattered, and was needed for the genre. At the London premiere on August 26, 2017, a photo of the moment when Romero had told Green to make another Hatchet film was put up on the screen behind Green. An emotional Green pointed to the sky and dedicated the film to Wes Craven and George A. Romero, who inspired him to ever try and make horror films in the first place. The film itself has a dedication to both filmmakers in the end credits.",

Bender called every screenwriter he knew, asking if they had any scripts set in a bank. Roger Avary lied and said he did, then furiously wrote the first draft in under two weeks",

Wealthy Colombian Manuel is interviewing a singer; when the waiter who is serving them spills wine on her he murders the man! The waiter has a brother, Mark, who works for the LAPD; he returns to the island and doesn't believe what he is told about his brother getting mixed up with gangs that have troubled the island in recent years. As Mark starts investigating Manuel sends his thugs after him... inevitably this goes badly for them and Mark has Manuel in his sights. It won't be easy though; Manuel is a danger to anybody close to Mark and he has a lot of people working for him.This is not a great film; the plot is fairly cliché and the outcome won't surprise anybody. That said no one would claim it aspired to greatness; it is just trying to be an entertaining action drama made on a relatively tight budget... at this is succeeds. The opening scenes effectively introduce the villain then our hero and the story is quickly under way. There are plenty of action scenes spread throughout the movie with just enough conversational scenes in between to advance the plot. The action is decent enough with martial arts and gun-play. Michael Jai White is solid as Mark; good enough to think he deserves better material in future. The rest of the cast are okay even if some are a bit hammy... the genre almost demands that. The setting, filmed in location in St Kitts and Nevis looks great. Overall I'd say this is fun enough; worth watching if you enjoy the lesser action films that were churned out in the '80s and '90s.",

Fardeen Khan hold's the record of the only hero in Hindi films to have the longest gap of 12 years between his movie releases. Kamal Haasan's last original Hindi release was Dekha Pyar Tumhara in 1985, and he returned to Hindi films with Chachi 420 in 1997. In between, he had several movies dubbed and released in Hindi. Rajnikanth's last original Hindi release was Bulundi in 2000. He had a special appearance in that film. After that he had several of his films also dubbed in Hindi. Fardeen's father Feroz Khan faced the camera after 11 years gap with Janasheen. The role was of the film's villain. The only other lead actor to return to acting of 12 years was Randhir Kapoor with the film Mother in 1999. Randhir's previous release was the long delayed film Khazana in 1987. The only difference was that Randhir Kapoor came back in a elderly character type role in the film (Though he was promoted in the film's publicity). So that makes Fardeen Khan the only lead actor in Hindi films to have the longest gap between his last and next release. His last release in 2010, Dulha Mil Gaya, saw him in the lead role. In 2022, he returned in a lead role with Visfot, and not a character role.",

When sound became available during the course of shooting, Sir Alfred Hitchcock re-shot certain scenes with sound, thus making it his first talkie. There was one complication with this change, however. Leading lady Anny Ondra had a thick Czech accent which was inappropriate to her character, Alice White. Joan Barry was chosen to provide a different voice for her, but post-production dubbing technology did not exist then. The solution was for Barry to stand just out of shot and read Alice's lines into a microphone as Ondra mouthed them in front of the camera. This is generally acknowledged as the first instance of one actress' voice being dubbed by another, even though the word \"dub\" is technologically inappropriate in this case.",

Hitchcock repeated his request several times, until Scotland Yard notified him that they would \"look the other way\" if he could do the filming in one night. Hitchcock quickly sent his cameras and actors out to Charing Cross Bridge to film the scene, but when the rushes came back from the developers, the scene at the bridge was nowhere to be found. Hitchcock and his assistants searched through the prints, but could not find it. Finally, Hitchcock discovered that his cameraman had forgotten to put the lens on the camera before filming the night scene.",

The liner was painted in the livery of a fictional shipping line, very similar to the livery used by the Soviet Morpasflot line, and renamed the \"Britannic.\" Advertisements were run in British papers, soliciting extras who would take a lengthy cruise in the North Sea for free, but with the knowledge that the ship would actually seek out the worst possible weather, as the story demanded seas too rough for the lifeboats to be lowered, trapping the passengers on board.They received 2,500 applicants and had to select 250. Weather was bad; Sir Ian Holm did not go on location but says he heard \"reports of horrible storms off Iceland and everybody getting drunk to deal with it. The story was the bar closed only between seven and seven-thirty in the morning.\"",

The studio, however, decided it would be too expensive to shoot a period picture, so the script was superficially updated --- the World War II vets became Vietnam vets, and actors and actresses like Robert Ryan, Karen Black, and Sheree North joined the cast. The result was that the story was restored to its original concept. (The series on which this book was based was written and set in the then contemporary 1960s and 1970s). Had the period piece idea gone through, this would have represented a rare case of backdating a character.",

The setting in this bleak and barren part of rural Mexico, and around a modern bunker-like villa seemingly in the middle of nowhere, gives it a disorienting, almost surreal feel, in sync with the premise of a young man in search for his mother, who a few years earlier got abducted and disappeared into thin air.There's some serious criticism towards the corrupt and violent (even homicidal) police, the relentless dominance of big corporations over helpless locals, and the gap between the rich and the poor. Impetuous Emiliano (Juan Daniel García Treviño) wants to make a stand against all this injustice, and at the same time hopes to find out who is responsible for his mother's disappearance. But he time and again fails to find the right way to do this, ignoring the warnings of his cautious family and friends, and stubbornly bringing himself in danger. When he at last ends up exasperated and a chased fugitive, he is only saved by a member of the rich and powerful family that he so hates.Garcia Treviño does a great job as Emiliano, convincingly making his anger and confusion palpable. Fernando Bonilla is equally convincing as the rich, self-indulgent and erratic Rigoberto. I liked the direction and the editing, with frantic action alternated by long introspective scenes of quiet looking out over the barren landscape, evoking a sense of intensity and foreboding.",

The story is reminiscent of a bland ZDF cheap movie. Very, very bad. There is also zero eroticism between the actors, who make an effort, and the director should look for a different genre. The characters are all replaceable, boring and half-baked. The same goes for their relationships. They never seem natural or at least halfway believable. The final stab in this lousy movie is the thin, horrible music that lies like a plastic carpet over all the scenes. Interesting what comes out of the Amazon lab.Don't waste your time. I did unfortunately.",

But it takes a lot not to cry at such amazingly built scenes, realistic CGI, and epic acting. One of my top three movies. Right above Birdemic and Velocipastor.I truly wish I could have seen this in cinemas. And I hope that one day, there will be a sequel, it would make all my dreams come true if me and all the loyal fans of this movie if we could just see more! Catnado is such a creative work and the different plotlines make for an interesting story that it's impossible to be bored while watching.Anybody that tells you different about this movie has clearly never witnessed pure artistic talent.

Thousands of fans from more than one hundred miles away gathered daily to filming locations in Dubuque, Iowa chanting \"Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!\" from behind rope and police barriers, and frequently only a block away from the on-set filming. Reportedly, Stallone would make about three pilgrimages a day to the security barriers to shake hands with fans, pose for photos taken with their Instamatic cameras, let some of the more daring kiss him. When time did not allow for signing autographs, Stallone apparently would say: \"You'd only lose it. A handshake lasts forever!\"",

The ending got really dumb and there weren't enough clues (none for that matter) that would allow a viewer to even guess what was going on.The lead wore so many extremely low cut V neck tops that I wondered if she was trying to advertise something.

Oh, and one little story that people might like: It was my first night there, I wasn't shooting but I was on the set to say hello to Phil Joanou, our director. Alec (Baldwin) had this scene where he had to jump into the water-pond, really-and swim across it. They're getting ready, they're all set up, Phil says, \"Here we go! Alec, you ready?\" \"Yeah!\" And suddenly alligator eyes appear on the water. Everybody freezes. \"There's a gator! Oh, my God!\" Alec says, \"It's cool. I'm going in.\" The stuntman goes, \"You're not going in!\" Alec says, \"Roll the camera!\" They roll the camera, Alec jumps in, crosses the pond, gets out. \"Okay, we got the shot?\" And we moved on. I couldn't believe it. He's got the balls of a dinosaur, dude. It was wild. True story! He really did that. It was cool!\"",

Her faith in the director James Toback had a lot to do with her willingness to bare all, but she also credited her maturity. \"[The nudity] did make sense, so I didn't feel I was compromising myself. And I think also, I'm just a little more comfortable with myself than I would have been five years ago.\" The only weird part she admitted was being fully naked in a shower with the director, cameraman and two other male crew staring at her from just a few feet away. But she admitted she'd still go nude again if the right role called for it.",

And deserves the view.Special mention for Cristiana Dell'Anna (Patrizia in the masterpiece TV series Gomorra) who is not seen in many scenes in this film, but when she does see herself she offers a truly excellent performance.",

I remember him coming back at one point, and he was all panicked. I said, \"What's the matter?\" He said, \"I can't find my guitar!\" Someone had just picked up his guitar case and walked off.

            "storyline": "\"Scarlet innocence\" is a romance-thriller movie that is loosely based on a Korean Pansori folklore tale \"Simcheongga\" which mainly tells a story of a daughter's devotion to her blind father. But this director and script writer was crazy enough to blend different genres into one movie focusing a woman Deokee who seduced or was seduced by that father Hak-Kyu and the tone of an ancient story is just freakishly changed. I took it for a look mainly for the appearance of handsome hero of \"Daisy\" Jung Woo-Sung. The movie's currently got an average mediocre rating of 6/10 from 225 users on IMDb, so I was even doubtful if the movie was actually worth watching. However he played here the role of a professor who went to small town after being accused of sexual harassment. There he met an innocent looking girl, fall in passionate love with her and then their relationship blossomed with suspense, betrayal, revenge and other controversial issues. The two leading Jung Woo-Sung and Esom revealed during promotion of film that they had consulted with their father and mother before shooting those close scenes. Esom later said that her mother was so convinced by her performance as pitiful Deokee that she cried a lot (One netizen commented on the news- \"If it was me, my mother would kill me right there-LOL!\") However a BTS also revealed that they were actually playful and enjoyed the shooting. Perhaps that's why good chemistry was developed under optimized direction & overall acting was that realistic even from the professor's daughter and other side characters' side. Jung as an experienced actor met up expectation from his controversial role charmingly. And Esom being a newbie actress portrayed duality of leading lady role (innocence & femme fatality) who was once betrayed by her love and then sought for sick revenge very judgmentally and that was one of the strongest part of this thriller along with some colorful cinematic visualizations and movements – she was really worth of her nominations as best new actress for that realistic and touching performance.Don't be blinded by love, don't be obsessed in revenge- otherwise some shitty things can happen and if the total storyline is presented realistically with some beautiful cinematography, so many turns in the plot, natural acting and insane direction, I who wasn't prepared to be haunted by such thriller with erotic tone can give it a damn solid rating of 8. OK, now for God's sake, I wanna get rid of such gratuitous realism!",

            "storyline": "I wish I could give this film a zero-star rating. One does not simply watch Desire (Desearás al hombre de tu hermana) - no, no, no, no, no. Desire is a film that one must endure. To put it simply, this movie is among the very worst of what cinema has to offer. If that's what you've been searching for, look no further. There are 1) no redeeming qualities whatsoever and 2) nothing compelling about the film. However, every time I see a film, I learn something, so I always enjoy seeing a film regardless of whether or not the film is 'good' or 'bad'. Now, in this circumstance, I must say that if I've learned but one thing, it's that everyone involved in making this film should be ashamed of themselves, with the exception of the child actresses - and especially the parents of those children, because those kids had no say in whether they wanted to be a part of this unholy mess. And I'm sure they had no idea what they were taking part in. Not only this, but I fear that they may grow up ashamed of their roles, though I hope they do not. It isn't their fault. This film is disgusting and positively lifeless. I've seen many disturbing films - grotesque, even - but this film is repugnant, repulsive, abominable. Never before have I seen a film that, while I sat there, thought \"I really would prefer if every copy of this film and every trace of it was wiped from existence.\" It's the only movie I've ever seen that I think one could argue is a declaration of war on cinema itself. I couldn't tell whether the film was trying to be funny and lampoon other erotic films, or whether the film was supposed to have 'that' type of humor. Being that it was the first result when I typed in \"erotic\" in Netflix's search menu, I incorrectly assumed it would be worth viewing. I couldn't have been more wrong. I simply wanted to explore a genre of films I don't normally watch, and this is what was waiting for me: what is, without a doubt (and without hyperbole), the worst film I have ever seen. In that way, this film reminds me of imitation sushi, always there waiting to be eaten by you . . . Even readily available to you. Yet, when you take a bite you simply confirm all your misgivings, reluctance, and reservations. In other words, don't try it.",

But that doesn't mean it's bad. It's entertaining, nice pace, i wasn't bored at all. I didn't hate acting and i had some fun, even though it was deeply flawed. I can say safely that it's getting kinda better as it's unfolding. I mean, after those terribly predictable first segments, the following are somewhat better. And the last segment was the best, by far. I liked that it tried to wrap it up. It didn't succeed at this but overall, it was enjoyable and the lead actress was very good.Overall, by no means this is a MUST WATCH.

But because of the failure of the TriStar film, Tomiyama said that studio felt that they \"couldn't keep silent until 2005\".",

The haunting is documented in M. V. Ingram's 1894 book, \"An Authenticated History of The Famous Bell Witch\". This movie was based on the book by Brent Monahan, \"The Bell Witch: An American Haunting the Famous Bell Witch\". However, the Ingram book has been called into question by researchers, who have noted that it's based on secondhand accounts and that no firsthand accounts to the haunting survive, and records from the time have not supported the story of the haunting. The Ingram book calls on quotes from letters and diaries but those documents no longer exist (if they ever did) and it is impossible to verify if the haunting actually happened or if it was a hoax or an early urban legend. Some researchers have even raised the possibility that the Ingram book was actually a work of fiction now mistakenly believed to be a factual account.",

            ],
            "storyline": "The Chapel is the new film of director Dominique Deruddere. 2022 was a great year for Flemish films with acclaimed works such as Close, Le otto montagne, Zillion and Rebel, and I was looking forward to see if the first high profile release of the new year could maintain this hot streak. The synopsis further piqued my interest: Jennifer Rogiers (Taeke Nicolaï) is one of 12 virtuoso pianists that are finalists for the world famous Queen Elisabeth competition. She and the 11 others have to stay in total isolation in the titular 'Chapel' for one week as they prepare for their performance in the final. While in seclusion, Jennifer is forced to confront her inner demons as well as deal with the tensions that arise between these competitors all striving for the same goal.Although the concept is an intriguing one, the movie doesn't exactly take it into unexplored territories. Through flashbacks that are interwoven with Jennifer's time at the Chapel, we get glimpses of Jennifer's relation with her overbearing mother (Ruth Becquart), who is quick to notice her 8-year-old prodigious talent and pushes her to the limit in order to maximize her potential. Jennifer's father (Kevin Janssens) on the other hand, doesn't want his daughter spending so much time behind the piano and seems to resent the elitism associated with classical music. While these flashbacks look good (especially the recurring shot of a young Jennifer going outside in pyjamas on a cold winter night has a haunting quality to it), they don't really do enough to flesh out these characters. The pushy, over-ambitious mother that wants to live her own dreams through her child and the alcoholic, abusive father aren't exactly original character types and after the first three flashbacks, I felt like I knew everything I needed to know about them.Another aspect I had some issues with is how the interactions between the finalists at the Chapel are being portrayed. Tensions inside the Chapel are understandably high, but I feel like this stressful environment could have been explored in a more interesting way. There is one character whose sole purpose seems to be to befriend Jennifer, despite Jennifer repeatedly denying her attempts at reaching out. This makes her feel less like a real character than a plot device (one interaction with Jennifer seems to hint a some repressed sexuality, but this is never further explored). And Nazarenko, Jennifer's main rival, also feels like a bit of a caricature, right from the moment he enters The Chapel in dramatic fashion and addresses the journalists in a laughably pompous manner. The mind games he plays with Jennifer feel especially transparent, although I guess it makes sense for her to be affected by his remarks and apparent unassailability, given her own fragile state of mind. And Jennifer does very much seem like a person headed towards a nervous breakdown as the final comes closer, as is demonstrated in a rather ill-advised night sequence right before her performance.The single-minded pursuit of perfection at the expense of mental health is a well-explored theme that brings to mind modern masterpieces like Whiplash and Black Swan. There are especially some parallels to be made with that latter one (lead girl with fragile psyche gets big break, deals with inner demons and a controlling mother, free-spirited friend helps her let loose etc.), but Black Swan digs so much deeper into its protagonist psychologically (and does it with much more visual bravura), that the character examination at the heart of The Chapel seems almost basic in comparison.It all leads up of course to Jennifer's performance in the final of the Queen Elisabeth competition and this is a stand-out sequence. Jennifer's piano play is intercut at a fast pace with the aforementioned winter night flashback, as both stories build towards their respective conclusions. Again, the central flashback is handled beautifully from a visual standpoint, but left me scratching my head a bit storywise.Despite there being some flaws in the storytelling and some parts that didn't work for me, I didn't think The Chapel was a bad film overall. The cinematography does a great job of contrasting the warm colors of the present day scenes with the colder looking flashbacks. The art design inside the eponymous Chapel as well as the costumes are beautiful. And Taeke Nicolaï has great screen presence in her first lead role, giving us a sense of both Jennifer's inner turmoil and fears as well as her perseverance and determination. The editing is also remarkable in that final sequence. Director Deruddere has a clear idea of the story he wants to tell and he achieves it. The story just isn't especially original and you end up wishing Deruddere had just dug a little deeper. Overall, it's a decent film, that doesn't really go in directions where other, better films haven't gone before (and beyond).",

The voices didn't seem to fit the actors, and the level was as if a teenager was talking. The moral is don't take the egg. The movie seemed very unpolished and amateurish. Crowd scenes didn't seem to be done very well, and the initial chase through the brush was very chaotic. There had to be some talent behind getting the movie done, but it didn't come across.

            "storyline": "I watched this film as I had recently re-watched the 1932 original, and found the story and premise to be a fascinating one.The basic story is as it has always been: a group of people on their way to a hunting trip (in this case a father and his son) get stranded on a remote island after a shipwreck, where they meet a reclusive baron who hunts men for sport. The cast aways, along with some others who were stranded there before, of course become the target of the baron's latest hunt. So far pretty interesting right?The first thought when I watched it was that it felt like a really cheap made for TV film. But on deeper reflection, that is giving it too much credit. The quality of this (in terms of acting, production values, script, direction) is more akin to the 'story' in an adult film where it seems like they did just one take to tick the box that yes they've done it and then move on to the next scene.The film really feels like it was made for a high school film club, in terms of both a near non-existent budget and people who couldn't act if their life depended on it. The delivery of lines of dialogue, both what is said and how its said, is silly to the point of making me laugh. In fact the only redeeming quality in this film was that some of the stuff was so bad that it was funny. I have no idea how the director shot some of these scenes, watched the replay and then thought that \"yes, that's a good piece of filmmaking, leave this in\", and how the editor later on didn't die of laughter splicing this together.The script also takes the viewer for a complete moron. The main character, played by Chris 'CT' Tamburello who's only claim to fame has been some reality TV shows, is a former soldier suffering from PTSD. You'd think mentioning this once would be enough? Not for the makers of this film who bring it up five or six times, plus numerous hilariously bad flashbacks to his time in the combat, just to make sure you didn't forget that he's a soldier during the c90 minute runtime.In some ways, the badness of this film is reminescent of Tommy Wiseau's The Room with the occasional unintentional laugh. But while as that film was made with passion and heart (as misguided as it may have been), The Most Dangerous Game was both bad and done with no effort and no budget. Its not even good enough to laugh at how bad it is.Truly a 2/10, watch the 1932 version of the story instead which is a really good film.",

And this is especially true in Asian cinema where women are either strongly sexualized and/or are a shallow bloodthirsty revenge tool or a sidekick or mysterious love interest.So this movie delivers in that regard, I really liked the actress and her character, her style, pretty much everything. The plot was ok for the most part, quite complex, I was having trouble following the opposing sides in the beginning, but the reveal was a little lacking. The build-up was ok, but I guess I was expecting a little bit more, and it ended somewhat illogically with the last head. Also I suspected the killer early on, there was something fishy about that guy lol...\nBut I won't fault it too much for that, I just won't rate it as highly but I think it's better than most Asian movies on Netflix.Also, I just realized she played the lead in Possessive. Which I also recommend. That was decent too. Good role also.",

Or else im quitting my job and becoming a producer to make it.",

He suffered from the antisemitism of the french society of the time and was wrongly accused (as it is shown in the film) of having shot pornographic movies as an actor. After Pathé went bankrupt in 1935, Natan was indicted on charges of fraud and imprisoned. He was then convicted in 1941 and his french citizenship taken away. After that he was transferred in 1942 to the camp of Drancy and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau where he would die.\nAlthough all of these traits are shared by the character of André Korben, it is to be noted that the passion for supernatural and spirits belong only to the fictional character, as it is not documented that Bernard Natan shared those interests at all.",

Marcus, who has just come out of prison is trying to make his life again with a new job and his family's support. One day, when he hears about a recent crime in news, that could lead to his brother, he chooses to protect him. What he does and how that affects him and his family is the rest of the film's story.Cinematic Analysis:\nCalling it a crime thriller might be misleading as there aren't any thrills involved here. The story is mostly focused on family dynamics, the ups and downs, and their daily lives. Heavy on conversations, the film tries to explore the impact a crime can have on people around us, especially our loved ones. It tries to bring us the inner conflicts and emotions they feel when something like this happens.The film is around 2 hrs long and the screenplay is extremely elongated. Instead of spending so much time on family get-togethers, if the makers would have invested some time to explain the backstory of our lead character, it surely would have helped a lot to connect with him on an emotional level and for a better understanding of the choices he made. The film focuses on things that are less important and never touches on the impactful aspects.The ending is surprising, never expected it to end this way. Performances are good but character development did have some scope to improve. On technical levels like cinematography, score etc., the film does a fine job.Conclusion:\nIn finality, The Devil You Know had a potential and impactful plot but the screenplay couldn't bring out our emotions or make us care for any of the characters. It lacks a tighter script and proper execution.Rating:\n5/10Follow Me On Instagram: M_Movie_Reviews.",

Three days before the shoot, Hrithik started practicing the stunts for five-six hours daily. It took us eight days to shoot the sequences in water. For another water action sequence, Hrithik trained for four days, before the shooting. He learned to jet-ski with a speed boat pulling him along first. Then, an antiquated plane was brought in with an experienced pilot at the controls, so that it could be slowed down and speeded up at will.\"",

            "storyline": "Ransomed is a Well balanced Thriller. This Well Go USA release is loosely based on real events that took place in the lead up the critically important 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics. When a previously kidnapped Korean Diplomat in Lebanon turns out to be alive a Korean Diplomatic office worker, played smartly by Ha Jung-woo, goes on a mission to deliver the ransom money and secure his release. When the mission gets dangerous and complicate he is forced to partner with an ex-pat, Korean taxi driver living in the area. That character is played by Ju Ji-hoon, and he is really, really great to watch. The film has elements of a spy thriller, action film, with the balance of the comedic aspects of an American \"Buddy Film\". There were times it reminded me of Escape to Mogadishu, which was more serious; at times of Argo; and at other times, Rush Hour. The end result of the film is one that is highly watchable and engaging. I highly recommend it. The acting, script, Direction, and cinematography are all very good. The supporting cast is very good in this, both on the Korean side, and inside of Beirut. Watch it in Korean, with English subititles.",

There are no surprises and Hy Hazell carries the film along with her enthusiasm. It takes a bit of a while to get going and it's ok while it lasts. It's a comedy so there is never really any real threat to anyone's life although the film does succeed in delivering some tension, eg, hiding in the bedroom. Of more interest is reading about Hy Hazell and the way she died in real life. She choked on a steak whilst eating at a Westminster restaurant at the age of 50. I want to know more.

Peppered with crisp and at times deliciously shady dialogue, the actresses playing both the possibly wicked and possibly innocent archetypes are on point. Characters are fleshed out nicely which allows us to relate to or revile them. I think all of us have encountered these personalities which make the proceedings all the more delightful. Solid performances, well written twists and turns and really beautiful cinematography make this a standout in the genre. Highly recommended.",

Only the Stadium and the Chancellorship were actually built, but the later was wrecked by bombings and finally looted and demolished by the Red Army. The rest of them were never built, and constructions like the Arch and the Dome were so massive, that architects were unsure of their viability, until recent computer-based simulation have stated that Speer's calculations were correct, and had Hitler won the war, Berlin would have pretty much looked as the movie shows. Interestingly, the movie also portrays Berlin as bleak and gray. In the book, March describes the city looking like this from the never ending construction projects.",

This one isn't scary either but I do think it's intelligent, respects its viewer and is made with passion instead of a cash grab project.Definitely recommended, it takes its time to build a proper story, to include the viewer, to make him question what's happening on the screen and also offers a good ending. So head to toes, a lovely experience here.Cheers!",

Farhana is story of a housewife who joins a call centre to earn a livelihood. When she moves to a new department which involved romantic chats with strangers, she struggles initially but was saved when she meets Dhaya. The long conversations with Dhaya was poetic and filled with love. As the viewer is lulled into a breezy romance, the story abruptly changes shade into a dark thriller and picks up pace. The event which leads to this change was when Farhana and Dhaya make plans to meet.Loved the way how the director manages to mold the movie into different genres with ease. Kudos to Nelson Venkatesan and his story-telling & direction. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!",

Lucky in the end, even if they didn't feel it at the beginning of the shoot. What was there from the start: a concept ... the main character and his issues and point of view ... the viewer is treated as partner to the filmmakers ... they give you something and you are able to make up your own mind ... what happened and how did it happen? So see it through his eyes ... but experience it through other people too ... who is on top of things? I love the ending too ... it may have some minor pacing issues within ... and you may not always agree on character choices ... but suspend your disbelief and go with it ...",

            "storyline": "In 2019, Takeshi Kitano released 'Kubi,' a Samurai novel, retelling the events of the 1582 Honno-ji incident, in which the powerful feudal Lord- or Daimyo- Oda Nobunaga was assassinated. It was an idea Kitano first had in the early 1990's, intended as a film. Akira Kurosawa was an advocate for the project, stating that \"if Kitano were to make this film, it would be a masterpiece on par with 'Seven Samurai'.\"In 2021, shooting finally took place, with a release two years later. The result is a sprawling, Shakespearian epic, bloody, thrilling and darkly funny. The film reimagines Nobunaga as a psychopathic ruler, sadistic and unpredictable. He pits the Samurai under him against one other, promising each the throne after he steps down. However, the various clan leaders, such as Hashiba Hideyoshi and Ankokuji Ekei, alongside Samurai general Akechi Mitsuhide, band against him, plotting his downfall.It is a tale that makes for a sweeping, action-filled picture, rocketing along at a brisk pace. The narrative is brimming with volatility, every character out for their own personal gain. There is plenty of back-stabbing- both literally and metaphorically- with betrayal as the dominant theme. Everyone is scheming and plotting; trust is not an easy virtue in Kitano's representation of the Sengoku period, and nothing- even love- gets in the way of self-interest.Kitano demystifies the notion that Samurai were bound by honour, portraying them as vicious killers, with little time for morality. More broadly, he shows how power-structures dictate relationships, as Nobunaga abuses- physically, mentally and sexually- those around him, taking advantage of their subservient position. This mirrors reality, and is a powerful, subtle piece of social commentary. Although perhaps not entirely factually-accurate, Kitano's depiction of the time-period and its characters is compelling and engaging.Furthermore, like most Kitano films, the undercurrent of humour, means that- despite rivers of blood and decapitations galore- it doesn't get too dark. In fact, it is a very funny film, striking a fine balance between comedy, thrills and drama. Moreover, Kitano's characterisation is astute. Every person is distinct, with their own quirks, while the dialogue is sharp and witty. Hashiba Hideyoshi is a particularly risible character, who features in the film's most hilarious scenes.In addition, the action is pulse-pounding and frenetic. Battle scenes are messy and visceral, as they would have been in real life. Katanas sweep through skin, limbs fly, heads roll- it is a gory and riveting affair. Much like his previous 'Zatoichi,' Kitano directs the action magnificently, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats throughout. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of the narrative ensures one doesn't know who will die next, or how; making things all the more exciting.Further, it is a striking looking film. Takeshi Hamada's grittily realistic cinematography is atmospheric and evocative. Much like his sterling work on Yojiro Takita's 'Departures,' his avoidance of flashy stylisations compounds the film's authenticity. He and Kitano shoot the fight scenes expertly, making them appear utterly crazy, while approaching the film as a whole with an artist's eye; some of the images and sequences involved are simply stunning.Moreover, the production design is minutely detailed. Everything looks period-accurate, and Kazuko Kurosawa's costume design is texturally rich and intricate. Additionally, the subtle score from Taro Iwashiro- who worked on Yoichi Sai's 'Blood and Bones,' which also starred Kitano- heightens the film's emotional impact. It is also a well-edited picture, moving at a stallion's pace from the start and never lets up.Part of the reason Kitano waited so long to film 'Kubi' was because he could never get his ideal cast, but, as he explains, when he was \"able to gather talented actors in the Kitano-group, and when such excellent actors come together, I felt like it was finally time to make it... and that's how it finally came to fruition.\" The cast he gathered is vast and noteworthy, which reads like a 'who's who' of premier acting talent.Ryo Kase is chillingly effective as the psychopathic Nobunaga, clearly loving the opportunity to play such a madman. Kenichi Endo does fine work as Araki Murashige, who is the first to rebel against Nobunaga, showcasing a vulnerability that is most affecting. Fans of his work will delight in seeing Kitano's longtime collaborator Susumu Terajima, brilliantly playing Sahei, a ninja, while Nakamura Shido II is most effective in the role of Naniwa Mosuke, a mad peasant who is determined to become a Samurai general, at any cost.Moreover, Nao Omori and Tadanobu Asano do typically excellent work as Hashiba Hidenaga and Kuroda Kanbei, accomplices of Hashiba Hideyoshi, underplaying effectively (as an aside, fans of 'Ichi The Killer' will surely enjoy seeing them on screen together again). Hidetoshi Nishijima brings a steady resolve to the role of Akechi Mitsuhide, and is very believable as one struggling, not just with his love for Murashige, but with the life he's found himself in. Finally, Takeshi Kitano, as arch-schemer Hideyoshi- disparagingly nicknamed The Ape- is marvellous, delivering a bewitchingly funny, layered performance that ranks alongside his best.A monumentally entertaining Samurai epic, Takeshi Kitano's 'Kubi' is a gripping story of betrayal and violence. Well-written, funny and thrilling, it's blood-soaked brilliance must be seen to be believed. With striking cinematography, stunning production and costume design and a stirring score, it fires on all cylinders. Boasting excellent performances from all in its star-studded cast, 'Kubi' is, as Akira Kurosawa predicted, a masterpiece.",

What should have been a captivating story on paper turned out to be a poorly constructed mess. The acting was mediocre, and the dialogues often felt forced and unrealistic. The cinematography and special effects, which usually have the potential to elevate a film, couldn't compensate for its shortcomings.It is outrageous that they are charging 5 euros for such a poor-quality film on Pathé home. For this price, I expect at least a decently crafted production, something this film utterly fails to deliver. The high rating is completely misplaced and does not reflect reality. It seems something went terribly wrong in the evaluation of this movie, as the end result is simply disappointing.In summary, this movie is not worth watching, and its rating of 8 is absolutely undeserved.

            "storyline": "\"My Wife's Hidden Lover\" (2023) delivers the typical Lifetime movie formula: drama, betrayal, and a twist you might see coming, but not in its entirety. While the movie is definitely watchable, it's plagued by inconsistencies and questionable character choices.The leading lady is far from sympathetic. Her infidelity, and her audacity in moving her lover into the attic of the house her husband paid for, is frustrating to watch. The husband's insistence on her not working is equally perplexing. If she can manage a clandestine affair, why not a secret job? Her constant \"I have to go...\" pronouncements and confused facial expressions do little to evoke empathy or further the story.The motivation for her supposed commitment to the husband - a promise to build a library using his influence - feels flimsy. The lavish lifestyle she enjoys is a more plausible reason for staying. And her willingness to cheat and so blatantly led me to believe she was looking out for herself and her own ambitions.The plot itself is riddled with holes. The husband's supposed influence with the police was heavily emphasized, yet when the cops arrive, it's the cheating wife holding the gun - a situation that would likely have led to her arrest. The boyfriend's fate at the end is left unclear. And if building a library was so easily achievable, why didn't she just do it herself in the first place? Definitely not an empowering message in this movie.Despite these shortcomings, the movie does manage to deliver a surprising twist--to me anyway. Other viewers said it was predictable, but I didn't see that one coming.One thing tho is that the heroine's happy ending feels unearned, considering her actions, but overall, the movie provides a decent dose of entertainment.",

Some of them are serious cyclists who want to race and they figure this is the best kind of work they can get because they're constantly training, but others are doing it because it's what they do for a living. Even though the guys may be eclectic, there is a strong sense of commitment\". Producer Daniel Melnick said: \"The actual bike messengers have one thing in common: problems with authority. They gravitate to this job because they can be their own bosses. No one is dependent on them but themselves\". Director Thomas Michael Donnelly said of Bacon's character that Jack Casey \"is a survivor on a very basic level. He returns to a more primitive tribal world to regain his spirit.
