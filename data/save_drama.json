This was because the film was originally made for TV, with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (or 16:9) in mind -- without the projectionists' manual correction, the aspect ratio of the theatrical release (1.85:1) would have resulted in heads being cut off at the top of the silver screen. Lynch also asked to raise the volume of the theater's sound system by three decibels when the film was playing. The note ended with the words, \"Your friend, David Lynch.\"",

I loved that the characters looked and acted like regular people, not the heavily manicured characters you get in most American TV. People in this movie had wrinkles, thinning hair, unflattering clothing, emotional outbursts, and said inane things regular people would say. Only one character was super thin. Even the rich mother character had obvious wrinkles. In American TV, you see very little of this- everyone gets a glow up. The plot of this movie isn't revolutionary, but it's sweet as expected for a holiday movie. It's a nice contrast to Hallmark movies.",

Due to a 1978 landmark government ruling (Oliphant v. Suquamish), the Supreme Court stripped tribes of the right to arrest and prosecute non-natives who commit crimes on native land. If neither victim nor perpetrator are native, a county or state officer must make the arrest. If the perpetrator is non-native and the victim an enrolled member, only a federally-certified agent has that right. If the opposite is true, a tribal officer can make the arrest, but the case must still go to federal court. This quagmire creates a jurisdictional nightmare by choking up the legal process on reservations to such a degree, many criminals go unpunished indefinitely for serious crimes.",

Unlike the film, however, this did not assist them in recovering the aircraft. The root cause of the crash was found to be inadequate maintenance of the airplane's stabilizer \"jackscrew,\" which caused its threads to wear down excessively and eventually jam the jackscrew. While the pilots were trying to reach Los Angeles for an emergency landing, the threads were ripped out and the stabilizer moved to a position that forced the plane into its fatal dive.",

The city needed to expand its acreage so that they could expand the harbor so they sold water lots. People would take an abandoned boat, scuttle it, and then claim the lot. To keep it they had to fill in the water by dumping rock, sand, and dirt. As it settled, much of it served to support the ships and many of the hulls were preserved largely intact. Decades later as underground utilities were being installed the ships were discovered. So far they have found some 500 of them. Much of downtown San Francisco was built on top of them,",

Thinking of the lyrics to \"Unchained Melody,\" he remembered, \"I always take it for granted that that's to a romantic partner, [but] what if I sing that to my mom?\" He sat down at the piano in his bathrobe and filmed it. \"And that way of channeling those emotions just felt true,\" the actor said. The video immediately caught director Baz Luhrmann's attention, as he was both confused and intrigued. Luhrmann stated, \"Was it an audition? Or was he having a breakdown?\" The director expressed that the audition felt like a spycam. Luhrmann asked to meet with Butler and eventually gave him the part.",

That's how you depict somebody intensely writing. But I thought, 'We can't have that. It's tropey and silly, and it doesn't get the audience's minds going.' So why not have these characters manifest in front of him? When I wrote that scene, I wrote the language to be very silly. It had to be ridiculous so that everybody could see how stupid this book is and what a sham it is. Then we got Keith David and Okieriete Onaodowan, who are both such tremendous actors. All of the sudden, it wasn't silly anymore. They made it seem like the book might be good. I love what the scene became in their hands: suddenly you're questioning whether or not the book is good, which is evidence that something as ridiculous as this book could become a hit.\"",

Despite a good deal of research, he did not feel he had enough solid factual information to make the movie. He then pitched the idea of a film that would cover a series of five samurai battles, based on the lives of famous Japanese swordsmen. Hashimoto went off to write that script, but Kurosawa ultimately scrapped that idea as well, worrying that a film that was just \"a series of climaxes\" wouldn't work. Then, producer Sôjirô Motoki found, through historical research, that samurai in the \"Warring States\" period of Japanese history would often volunteer to stand guard at peasant villages overnight in exchange for food and lodging. Kurosawa then came across an anecdote about a village hiring samurai to protect them and decided to use that idea. Kurosawa wrote a complete dossier for each character with a speaking role. In it were details about what they wore, their favourite foods, their past history, their speaking habits, their reaction to battle and every other detail he could think of about them. No other Japanese director had ever done this before.",

I don't know how anyone can make a movie and not rehearse. Even if you can't put it into the budget, figure out how to rehearse on weekends. That's what I preach because it just saves you so much time while shooting. You get to work out the kinks and bumps, and if the blocking doesn't quite work, or an actor's bumping on a line, or whatever. You have time to rewrite it, you can rework it with them. Also, we rehearsed with my DP (Menno Mans), so we were changing the shot list, we were finding better, more exciting ways to shoot a scene. So, by the time we got to shooting, on the day we could just fly... I think that I wouldn't be able to sleep the night before if I didn't know exactly what I was doing that day. (Laughs) I don't know how people do it. I mean, yeah, some people get off on that kind of spontaneity, but the thing is, something unexpected will always come up in filmmaking. It's like, no matter how much you prepare, too, no matter how much you rehearse, something unexpected will always come up. I think that that's the beauty of filmmaking. But for me, at least, when you're prepared ahead of time, you know exactly what you're doing coming in, then you can make those pivots very quickly because you've done all the work, and you've done all the prep.\"",

None of the studios agreed as they wanted to hire another actor. Then Robert De Niro offered to go into a 50/50 partnership, with all of Palminteri's conditions met, as long as De Niro could direct and play Lorenzo. Palminteri agreed, and their contract was sealed on a handshake.",

By following these two steps, Soderbergh was able to sidestep a Hollywood studio, and had creative control the entire time (for instance, the trailers that dropped earlier on n the summer were by his design, as was the poster and the entire marketing plan). Also, according to Soderbergh, under this set-up, the box-office bar for success was lower. With nearly everything prepaid, and no hefty distributor fees coming off the top, even a modest fifteen million dollar opening would be a win.",

King also wrote the script for the TV mini-series The Stand (1994). His original novel featured a (male) character named Ray Flowers; upon hearing that Bates wanted to be involved in the miniseries, King re-wrote the part as a woman (Rae Flowers) just so Bates could play the part (uncredited).",

Ravi Basrur's bgm aren't my favorites but this was even worse than all his previous works. Arjun Sarja's previous directorial works (especially those starring his daughter) were goofy, so it would be natural he's going to mess up with Dhruva Sarja's Martin. But this time the director is AP Arjun who had given some decent rom com hits to Dhruva Sarja before. His direction was ok in some scenes but in all others it fails miserably.There were twists in first half. Though they were all predictable, some came off a surprise due to screenplay style. And just when I started to feel this is going to be good, it started to go down again. And this time it messed up even badly, with choppy editing, a loud and jarring senseless bgm, weird dialogue delivery (there's a dialogue that rhymes martin with protein), tanks, bikes, bombs, green screen deserts, cgi fights, and many more!There were some good camera shots but those were very few. The color grading is average. Other production values are barely decent. The only good thing about the movie is that they didn't reveal anything in the trailer. They deliberately kept the audience's expectations low so that this film can at least be called \"average\" when it's below that! There were no comedy scenes in the movie (at least better considering how vulgar kfi's comedies are), perhaps because the film itself is a joke?!There is everything in the movie except a logical story and good direction. Better to skip, unless you want to hide inside a theatre for whatever reason.",

Contrary to popular belief, Spielberg claims he introduced many of the darker elements into the story, while Kubrick's main contribution consisted mostly of its \"sweeter\" parts. In a 2002 interview with movie critic Joe Leydon, Spielberg indicated that the middle part of the movie, including the Flesh Fair, was his idea, whereas the first forty minutes, the Teddy bear, and the last twenty minutes were taken straight from Kubrick's story. Ian Watson, who wrote Kubrick's original treatment, confirmed that even the much-criticized ending, assumed by many to be a typical Spielberg addition, was \"exactly what (he) wrote for Stanley, and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg.\"",

He landed at Charles De Gaulle Airport near Paris in 1988, after being denied entry into England because his Iranian passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. French authorities wouldn't let him leave the airport, so he remained in Terminal One, a stateless person with nowhere else to go. He was eventually granted permission to either enter France or return to Iran, but he chose to live in the terminal and tell his story to anyone who would listen. Reportedly, his mental health deteriorated over the years. When given the opportunity to live in France, he refused because the documents did not identify him as \"Sir Alfred\", and he claimed to have forgotten his native Persian. He left the terminal in August 2006 to be hospitalized for an unspecified illness. Afterward, he lived in a hotel on the money received from the film (DreamWorks reportedly paid him $250,000 for the use of his biography). Nasseri moved back to Charles de Gaulle airport in October 2022. He died in terminal 2F on November 12, 2022.",

The Brooklyn newsboy who got the nickel thought it felt too light. He dropped the nickel on the sidewalk, and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm with a coded message inside. After Hayhanen's blunders, Abel lost confidence in him and sent him back to the U.S.S.R., which would not have gone well for Hayhanen, who defected in 1957. He showed the FBI how to crack the code and it was Hayhanen who gave up Rudolf Abel. The \"Hollow Nickel Case\" was also dramatized in The FBI Story (1959).",

With her newborn daughter with her, she decided to stowaway on a RORO ferry on its way to Manila.She was planning to go to Segovia in Pampanga province to seek shelter in the house of her brother Toto (Felix Roco) and his wife Shiony (Shiena Yu) to get her bearings back. On the bus, a seaman named Rod (Mark Anthony Fernandez) helped her when she was being harassed by ruffians who saw her breastfeeding.Rod paid for her bus fare and patiently listened to Lineth tell him about the ordeal she went through in the hands of the ship captain Ramos (Julio Diaz) and his minions (Rash Flores, Chad Solano and Alvaro Oteyza), and about the old woman (Erlinda Villalobos) who took pity on her. The simple title once again has a double meaning here.Being about a stowaway, \"pamasahe\" first refers to the \"ticket fare,\" which Lineth did not have. Lineth just so happened to have skills in massage, so that was what the Captain requested in return for letting her stay on board, with \"pamasahe\" meaning a \"request for a massage.\" Being a Vivamax film, you can probably guess what more Lineth had to give the men instead for her fare, or after the massage.The scenes of rape, and other perversions like incest and adultery, were also given so much screen time than it was necessary. This poor young woman Lineth suffered the most degrading, humiliating and disgusting abuse at the hands of various men her whole life to date. We did not really need to repeatedly see every repulsive detail of these sick, degenerate acts. These scenes tended to bog down the momentum of the storytelling than enhance it.For a neophyte, Azi Acosta was able to more than adequately portray the miserably melodramatic life story of her chronically-victimized character. Mark Anthony Fernandez tried his best to play against type as a helpful co-passenger, but always with a nagging sense of suspicion about him. Diaz, Flores, Solano and Oteyza can already do lecherous and lascivious blindfolded, as they've done many times before. Vivamax viewers will not be surprised anymore that there will be a violent turn of events after all of the sex scenes have been shown.The moment they focused on someone's pistol at the beginning, you knew this gun will figure significantly later on. However, just when we thought we've predicted exactly how Lineth's story was going to end, cult-director Roman Perez, Jr. Came up with an 11th hour twist to mess with our minds at the very end.",

When Tim Burton expressed interest, however, Sondheim relented when pleased with Burton's vision for the project, and on the condition that the composer would maintain casting approval. Burton would only agree to direct with Johnny Depp in the lead, and though Sondheim feared Depp's vocals would be too \"rock oriented,\" the composer approved the actor after a vocal audition. To approve the casting of Helena Bonham Carter, and to combat any rumor of nepotism (as Carter and Burton were romantically involved), the actress sent Sondheim no less than twelve audition tapes of her singing. Very impressed with her vocals, Sondheim immediately approved the actress. Also, in his 2010 book about his career as a songwriter, \"Finishing the Hat,\" Sondheim states this is the only adaptation of one of his works for the screen for which he approves.",

As mentioned in my title, if you're looking for a history lesson, please trying reading some books. No one went to see the movie \"300\" hoping to gain historical insights into the Spartans, did they?Back to the movie itself. The story is very straight forward and action-driven. Is it such a unique and memorable story? No. Are there some plot holes? Sure. Personally, I had a hard time accepting the fact that the \"misunderstanding\" that separated the two main characters was so easily resolved at the end. Anyways, the final question is was it entertaining? The answer to that is YES! I especially liked the three-way battle in dense fog.In summary, this movie will provide you with enough entertainment to justify your investment of 2 hours of viewing time. I give this movie a solid 7 stars. I'm also adding 2 stars to offset some of the ridiculously low scores given for reasons that seem unfair.",

Stallone suggested that the film could piggyback the real event, using the real HBO format, the real crowd, even the real press conference setup. As such, the press conference scene was shot only moments after the real press conference with Hopkins and Taylor, whilst the scene when Rocky walks through the curtain and down to the ring was shot using the real Hopkins/Taylor crowd. Stallone was hoping that the crowd wouldn't boo or cause any problems, but as he made his way to the ring (as Rocky), the whole building gave him a standing ovation and began to chant 'ROCKY, ROCKY'. The crowd was never told to stand up or to chant - they had done it completely on their own, and according to the filmmakers, by far the biggest cheer of the night was for Rocky, not for any of the real fighters.",

When the girls and women awoke bruised and covered in blood, the men of the colony dismissed their reports as delusions (even when they became pregnant from the assaults) or punishments from God or by demons for their sins. According to a May 2019 BBC article by Linda Pressly, when the assailants were finally caught, they were arrested by Bolivian authorities. One fled from justice, but the other eight were tried and convicted. Seven were sentenced to 25 years in prison for repeated, multiple rapes; an eighth was convicted for providing the drug, then released. According to a 2013 Vice article by Jean Friedman-Rudovsky, some men and boys in the colony had also been raped, and the druggings and rapes continued after the arrests.",

            "storyline": "Purna Bahadur Ko Sarangi is that unique addition within Nepali filmmaking whereby extraordinary storytelling combined with a powerful message touches the heart of audiences at a personal level. Skillfully and sensitively directed, it is the saga of Purna Bahadur, a father whose big dreams regarding his son are furthered through fighting off merciless realities in life. It narrates the voyage of one such commoner, who walks along with spirits of resilience, love, and relentless pursuit of success.The film introduces us to Purna Bahadur, a character whose life has assumed a definition of struggles faced by countless parents around. Purna is that one man who, despite the inadequacy of his resources and innumerable obstacles, carries an unflinching hope for his son's future. His character is the epitome of love and the sacrifices parents make for their children, and his dreams are never for personal benefit but so that his son may live a life free of the struggles he has gone through. That's highly realistic and hence poignant as the storyline pulls at the heartstrings of audiences who perhaps have been part of such family moments.One of the mainstays of this film is Bijay Baral as Purna Bahadur. Acting by Baral is nothing less than brilliant as he gives life to his character so naturally and authentically. His acting does not depend on high fanfare or exaggerated expressions but in the subtlety and telling expressions that create a mark for his character. From pain in his eyes at very crucial moments to a hopeful smile that gets permanently glued whenever he dreams about his son's future, Bijay Baral truly carries this movie upon his shoulders. His commitment to his role is palpable, and it's bound to leave a dent in viewers' minds.The cinematography of the movie reveals the vision of the director in capturing the most mundane struggles of Purna Bahadur. Indeed, together with the settings and costumes, plain simplicity is presented in his life. Not only does a small-town backdrop with a minimal setting show the limitations that Purna goes through, but it makes his journey so touching. This helps the audience plunge deep into his world with much empathy.The pacing in this film is measured, offering enough time to develop its characters without the feeling of drag. It goes slower to give one time to more fully absorb the emotional journey of the characters. Every scene is done in such a way that either furthers the story or deepens our understanding of Purna's internal struggle for self-will. It's a quietly effective building story full of highs and lows, just like those in life.More than the story of one man and his dream, Purna Bahadur Ko Sarangi speaks to bigger truths that most will find relatable, largely revolving around family, hard work, and the importance of dreams. It's a reminder that life seldom comes easy, and success is oft well-earned, but love and family sacrifices make all the difference in the world. The film is a celebration of local culture for Nepali audiences and acts as testament to the willpower of common people who go through all adversity to secure a better future for the next generation.All in all, Purna Bahadur Ko Sarangi is a gem within the Nepali movie industry-representing top-notch acting, especially Bijay Baral, with a well-penning storyline that tugs at the heart. This movie epitomizes the very core of struggle and hope; rather than a movie, it is an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. A must-watch for all those who love stories direct from the heart, an example of very strong humanness inside us.",

As much as I want movies (to release), this is way worse. At least the marketing departments at both studios have something to sell that looks big and glossy.

Elizabeth Reaser (Rose) and Lois Smith (Helen) are brillant in bringing to life two women with shared experiences of loss and of being lost.It will stay with me for a while this one.",

Another goddamn stand-up comedian here to make fun of us at our sacred rituals.' Well, I'll have you know, I'm not such an outsider. I am quite sought after in the film world. I would like to share with you a real email that I got from my agents about thirty days ago. This is an actual email that they sent me on December 7th, [2023,] so you'll get an idea of who you're dealing with. 'John, in anticipation of our conversation, attached please find the untitled Maggie Gyllenhaal project written and to be directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.' That makes sense. 'Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Osnat Handelsman[-Keren], and Talia Kleinhendler are attached to produce for Warner Brothers. Christian Bale is negotiating to star opposite Jessie Buckley.' I know who one of those people is. 'There is no script available at this time.' Okay, I'm listening. 'Pending, pending your response to the material. Please use the attached sides to put yourself on tape for the role of Young Cop.' Let's, thank you. They really sent this to me. WME [the entertainment agency William Morris Endeavor] sent this to me, let me be clear. I'm not being OFFERED Young Cop. They're giving me the chance to throw my hat in the ring. And yes, I put myself on tape, and, no, I didn't get it, but. . . . Let's stop focusing on failure, all right? Enough failure. Tonight, there are only winners.\"",

Post-production in Amsterdam had to be delayed until June 2019 to allow time for him to recover from his surgery. However, subsequent complications from pain medication caused an intestinal obstruction that ended in a life-threatening colon perforation; fortunately, Verhoeven's wife urged him to go to the hospital in time. Verhoeven and producer Saïd Ben Saïd agreed to delay the release to 2020 in order for Verhoeven to recover, and be fully present during the post-production process. Verhoeven still credits his editor Job ter Burg for finishing much of the film on his own while he himself was recovering and unable to attend. Eventually, the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic caused the movie to be delayed for another year.",

After doing three takes of Rocky taking shots to ribs, Stallone felt a burning in his chest, but ignored it. Later that night, he had difficulty breathing and was taken to a nearby emergency room. It was discovered that his blood pressure was over 200, and he had to be flown on a low-altitude flight from Vancouver, Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where he remained in intensive care for four days. What had happened was that Lundgren had punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body. . However, when asked about whether or not it really happened while answering a series of fan questions in a 2021 interview with the Guardian, Lundgren claimed to have no recollection of the incident. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"[Stallone] keeps talking about it, so maybe he's right. He did go to the hospital, but I don't know whether it was my punches or the fact that he was so overworked as the director, actor and writer. We shot those 15 rounds over two or three weeks, eight or 12 hours a day, so you're throwing thousands of punches. If you don't connect, it looks a bit fake, but it doesn't mean you want to hurt the other guy. But there were no hard feelings.\" He went on to explain that stand-ins and stunt doubles were rarely used, and that he has performed the majority of his own stunts and fight scenes--but that this has changed in more recent years. \"Back in the day, you had to do it all yourself: Rocky IV, The Punisher, Masters of the Universe, all the Expendables,\" he said. \"I've jumped from a motorcycle to a truck; dangerous things I would never do now. Staying physically fit over the years has been nice. There aren't many actors who can stay physically fit for a long time. Part of the game is trying to look fit, at least.\"",

Instead of expanding existing scenes with the new footage, the entire film was edited from scratch, which resulted in a version that doesn't contain a single frame from the theatrical version. Visual effects were used to enhance scenes and replace cheap sets and backgrounds, and AI technology was used to restore previously unusable dialogue that was plagued with background noises. A new music score was composed as well, in contrast to the public domain ballet music. A limited theatrical release was planned in late 2020, but it was delayed due to legal difficulties, distribution issues and the Covid-19 pandemic. This version eventually premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023, with high remarks by actors Malcolm McDowell (who previously had been ashamed by the film) and Dame Helen Mirren.",

I improvised the whole movie. I was only ever shown the first ten pages and even they were thrown away once we were on set. We shot the movie in 8 days. I was drawn to the idea of how it would feel stepping into scene after scene having no idea what was gonna be thrown at me. I've never taken on anything like that and it was both challenging and exhilarating. You can't help but be in the moment.Obviously there were certain parts where I would have to be guided in a general direction but mostly it was flying by the seat of my pants. Amazing work by the rest of the cast having to play off me given I had no idea what was about to come out of my mouth. And to our director Brian Goodman-love you brother.\"",

I go away and do a film like Monster's Ball with a very explicit sex scene with Halle Berry. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world and I am talking on the phone to my wife, and she says, 'What have you been doing today?' And I say, 'Oh, I did that sex scene with Halle Berry.' You are then asked if you actually touch her. I say, 'I had to - it's in the scene'. Other people's situations are hard, with areas of doubt.

Like Before Sunrise (1995), this is based on events in director Richard Linklater's own life. He had once spent a night walking and talking around Philadelphia with a woman called Amy in 1989. Though they initially stayed in touch over the telephone, they lost contact eventually. In 1994, Linklater shot Before Sunrise (1995), based on his night with Amy. Like Jesse in \"Before Sunset\", Linklater was secretly hoping that Amy had heard of the movie, and would show up at the premiere, but she did not. When \"Before Sunset\" was released, she did not show up either. It wasn't until 2010, before Linklater started production on the second sequel, Before Midnight (2013), that a friend of Amy, who knew about their story, contacted Linklater to tell him that Amy had died in a motorcycle accident on May 9, 1994, at the age of 24, a few weeks before he started shooting Before Sunrise (1995).",

Shadow tries to get out but the pit is large and deep and muddy and he keeps slipping back into the pit because he cannot get a good grip. To accomplish this scene, a special pit was dug which was about three to four feet deep. For the sliding back and forth, one trainer was at the top of the pit calling the dog. Another trainer was at the bottom telling the dog to stay. When he did, he would naturally start sliding downward. The dog could actually walk out on his own at any time and did so several times during the filming. When Shadow does appear at the end of the film to be reunited with Peter, Shadow runs with a limp. This was accomplished by putting part of a round wooden bead between the dog's toes. The bead did not hurt him in any way, but gave him a peculiar sensation, causing him to walk with a limp.",

You see my skirt go up over my head when I'm being gang raped, but it's like so perfectly done. 'Chloe' is so graphic. And this is not...(Peter Sarsgaard and I) are not shy about our private parts. We also weren't walking around with our genitals out; our bottom half genitals. That might have been a little strange for me. I don't really have any interest in people seeing my vagina. It's just a personal thing. I don't mind seeing other people's vaginas. I guess I'm just insecure in that way. Peter, same thing. He was always covered up in that way. I think it's just our mutual understanding of we needed to be naked a lot of points in the movie and it wasn't a big deal. It's like a costume. I don't know why I feel comfortable. To be honest, when I was younger, I was terrified of sex. I don't know what happened over the years. I now have an appreciation for it, for people who don't put so much heaviness on it. I also don't understand why it's censored in movies.\"",

His tank was too small, with too-warm chlorinated artificial salt water. Keiko suffered from a weakened immune system and a skin condition around his pectoral fins. There was a monumental effort to release Keiko. A custom tank was built in the Oregon Coast Aquarium and in 1996, the whale was flown from Mexico to Oregon. He recovered well, and was moved to a sea pen in 1998. In July 2002, Keiko was released into the wild after spending 22 years in captivity. Unfortunately he did not fully adapt to the wild and died in December 2003 in Norway. Keiko became the second oldest orca to live in captivity.",

Normally, the assistant director would read the actors' lines, and the extras would react. However, Laughton, who was fascinated with the whole process of filmmaking, begged to help. So he came in on his day off and read all of the off-camera speeches to the jury members. He not only read his part but also the judge's, the prosecutor's, and even Marlene Dietrich's. According to biographer Maurice Zolotow in his book \"Billy Wilder in Hollywood\", \"it was an exhibition of craftsmanship such as Wilder had never seen. He believes that Charles Laughton had the greatest technical range and power of any actor, man or woman, whom he has known.\"",

We'd find out how far that was when we got there. Then for two days we talked through the scenes point by point, in complete detail and without inhibitions, discussed every second of these scenes - completely and candidly. What does the character feel, what gets him/her excited, why? What kind of power relationships are at work? At what point do they change? And so on... What turned out well - and this is what is often the problem in sex scenes - is that the actors were always aware that they were characters, that they were playing the story and sexuality of characters. That gives you protection, lets you take greater risks. Because of this, the shoots were very exciting and sometimes really moving.\"",

In 1995, the film, which was set to be written and directed by John Milius and would star Laurence Fishburne and Gary Sinise, was two weeks away from shooting, before it was shut down, due to the financial collapse of Savoy Pictures. In 2012, Christopher McQuarrie signed on with Paramount Pictures to direct the film, with Tom Hardy in talks to play John Clark and Kevin Costner in talks to play his mentor, William Harper. In September 2018, it was announced that Michael B. Jordan would be playing John Clark in a two-part film series, which will be composed of 'Without Remorse' and 'Rainbow Six'. Director Stefano Sollima was announced in December 2018 and filming began in Berlin in October 2019.",

The only real lack I found was in the acting but, to be fair, the four child actors are young so it s excusable. In my experience, it was not bad enough that the watcher is cast out of the movie.

We wanted to make it better, and we've had Disney's full support in doing that.\" Director Joe Wright planned five days for pick-up shots aimed at getting the film back on track.",

Thus, a Carnotaurus was used.

While this continued on broadcast television well in to the late seventies, the barrier in movies fell in 1960 (two years after the Pleasantville scenario) when Alfred Hitchcock persuaded the film censors to allow the flushing of a toilet in Psycho (1960) because it was integral to the iconic shower scene.",

The director marked his victory, when we get goosebumps for Attakatthi Dinesh. Highly entertaining sports drama with very good social message without any preaching tone.The background songs, Vijayakanth are used for mass moments. Without any punch dialogs, without mass hero, the movie has fantastic mass moments in the second half.The dialogs are nicely written and all the actors did their job very well. The one liner, sentiment, love sequences are perfectly gelled with Cricket.The best part is that the comedy layer in all sad/joy moments make the audience laugh from beginning to end. After long time, I enjoyed the perfect entertainer by forgetting the real world around me.I would highly recommending this movie to anyone.Worth the watch.",

This was an opportunity for me to make a film like that. I've done thrillers before, but this was the first time it involved this cat-and-mouse aspect to it. I was really intrigued by the family dynamic, the daughters, the nature of grief, this doctor who's essentially someone that's composed and tries not to panic, found himself doing just that,\" Elba tells Complex about the survival thriller directed by Baltasar Kormákur. \"I just love the script. I love Baltasar, the director. I wanted to work with him. He's made some really incredible survivor movies, and I just wanted to get his take on what this might be like.\"",

Farrell was told he'd learned so much, he was welcome to participate in a real sting operation. During the operation (caught on video, excerpts of which are shown in the DVD extra), guns were drawn and the officers identities questioned. Farrell reports being scared for his life. He spontaneously ripped open his shirt to demonstrate he wasn't wearing a wire, an act the agent-in-charge later commended for being realistic, quick-witted improvisation. After suffering anxiety and insomnia that night, Farrell contacted the agent-in-charge and was told that the sting operation was staged, and he was never in any danger. He was to be told the next morning during a debrief.",

Repeat offenders were sent there; the rapists, murderers, hardened criminals. And severe punishments were devised for them to strike fear in the hearts of those back in Britain, to deter them from crime. Women on the other hand, who'd often committed minor crimes, were sent to Tasmania to even the gender balance. They were outnumbered eight to one. You can imagine what kind of an environment that would set up for women. It was not a good place or time for them. And in terms of the Aboriginal invasion, what happened in Tasmania is often considered the worst attempted annihilation by the British of the Aboriginal people and everything they hold dear.\"",

A lot of the visual references actually were from mid-century street photographers, who obviously shot on film. When Larkin Seiple came on board to shoot it, we looked at each other and we were like, 'This has to be on film, right?' We tested 35, 16 millimeter, and some digital grain filters. But it was clear after the test that there was only one choice, and I didn't want fake grain on this. I wanted to be ingrained in more of an American look.\"",

Erice had submitted an in-progress version of the film to Cannes in March 2023, followed by a further version with the final colour grading and sound mixes, and had requested that Frémaux inform him in advance whether the film would be in the Official Competition so that, in the event that it was not, Erice could take the film to another festival such as Venice or Locarno. Erice stated that there was no communication from Frémaux to him as he had requested and that he discovered the film had been selected for the Cannes Première section when the Festival's lineup was announced on 13 April. Erice did not attend the Cannes screening of the film.

(His favorite dish was linguine with clams.) One day in March, 1984, Cunningham asked Penzo for help picking his weekly lottery numbers. Penzo suggested three numbers, and Cunningham came up with three more numbers on his own. Cunningham jokingly promised that if he won, he would split the winnings with Penzo as a tip. The next day, to Penzo's surprise, Cunningham and his wife came to the diner with the winning lottery ticket in hand. Cunningham's ticket had won $6 million, which he split with Penzo, giving her $3 million. In real life, however (as stated in a disclaimer at the end of the movie), Cunningham and Penzo were both happily married to other people for many years.",

The Pendleton was a T2 style tanker that, as with other \"liberty ships,\" was built in haste during the Second World War to support the Allies in Britain. The limited building facilities resulting from the rush of shipbuilding resulted in the T2 ships being built in two sections (bow and stern) and later joined at the middle. They had a known issue in that they tended to break in half when facing the combination of cold seas and extreme weather.\nBy insisting on maintaining 7 knots, the captain was hoping to reach a port as quickly as possible, in order to limit the amount of stress on the ship and to avoid metal fatigue that might lead to a break-up. He was balancing the threat of a broken weld versus breaking the ship in two. If he had complied with the engineer's request and dropped to 3 knots, the break-up would have happened anyway, but farther out to sea.\nIt is likely that, while losing his life and that of the other seven crewmen in the bow, his decision made it possible for the lives of the other half to be saved. In contrast to what has been reported elsewhere, the broken weld had little to do with the ship being broken in half. Rather, the weld broke due to the same strain that caused the ship to break in half.",

After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being \"silly,\" and the church was \"beautiful.\" Nicolas Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life in terms of what the characters would actually say to each other, and that the scripted version was \"overwritten,\" so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.",

The five-man team were allegedly given the contract on Hoffa by Tony Provenzano, a captain in the Genovese crime family. Kuklinski claimed to have been paid $40,000 for the hit. Kuklinski said that he knocked Hoffa unconscious with a blackjack and, while holding Hoffa's chin up, thrust a hunting knife into the back of his head. Hoffa's body was then allegedly placed in the trunk of a car that was then crushed and sold as scrap metal to Japanese car makers. The claims only surfaced after Kuklinski's death in March 2006 in a book by author Philip Carlo and will probably never be substantiated.",

According to Pedro Almodóvar, the MPAA did not believe an R rating was appropriate, even after cuts, because they were afraid that the film would inspire young men to kidnap young women out of lust. Miramax argued that an X rating implicated pornography and would diminish the film's audience, but they lost the lawsuit and it was released unrated. In September 1990, the MPAA replaced the X rating with the then-newly created NC-17 rating in response to numerous appeals by other filmmakers who had released their films under similar circumstances in the past. Eventually, the film was re-rated NC-17 for its first two (of three) U.S. home video releases (it was re-released unrated the third time; see below), the reason being the explicit scene of a naked Marina taking a bath in her apartment and masturbating in the bathtub under the water with an activated swimming scuba diver wind-up toy.",

On November 14, 1970, at 7:35 PM, the plane crashed into a hill just short of Tri-State Airport, killing all 75 on board.\nBecause it was the team's only chartered flight of the season, many prominent citizens were on board, including a city councilman, a state legislator, and four of the city's six physicians. Seventy children lost one parent in the crash; an additional 18 were orphaned.",

Schumacher agreed. Then out of the blue, Nicolas Cage's agent called Schumacher and told him that he wanted to do the film as well. Schumacher then contacted John Calley at Sony and told him that we can do the film with Crowe as a \"low budget, dirty handheld camera thriller\" or a much bigger film with Cage. Calley then agreed to do the film with Cage as the lead which eventually led to a much bigger budget. Schumacher realized Cage was right for the part when Cage reportedly told him, \"I want to play a role I can internalize instead of my normal Schtick.\"",

Twenty years later the novel was filmed with some changes: the daughter became his wife, Claxxon became the Nakatomi Corporation, Joe Leland's name was changed to John McClane, and the film was released under the title Die Hard (1988). Because of a clause in Sinatra's contract for \"The Detective,\" which gave him the right to reprise his role in a sequel, he was actually the first person offered the McClane role even though he was 73 years old at the time. Also, coincidentally, Bruce Willis (who played McClane) made his movie debut in The First Deadly Sin (1980), walking out of a bar as Sinatra walked in. Additionally, Lloyd Bochner played Dr. Wendell Roberts in this movie. His son, Hart Bochner, played Harry Ellis in Die Hard (1988).

He makes excuses for his shortcomings and inaction. Nevertheless, when penguins coated in industrial oil wash up on a beach and fascists seize power in a coup, Tom is in for a deep awakening despite himself.Steve Coogan (Tom) and Jonathan Pryce star in this true story of wit, warmth, counterintuitive discoveries, humor, drama, and cute penguin antics. There is real depth to the dialogue, characters, story arc, and acting. The Penguin Lessons was filmed in Spain with an Argentine cast. Many of the actors lived through the recent dictatorship in Argentina and they add authenticity to the story. At the world premiere screening of the film at the Toronto International Film Festival I was deeply moved in the understanding that merely one person, or penguin, can make a big difference in the world in the face of such evil and tragedy.Rise like lions after slumber\nIn unvanquishable number\nShake your chains to earth like dew\nWhich in sleep had fallen on you\nYe are many, they are few., - Shelley.",

Two weeks before Jay and Silent Bob Reboot was released, however, Smith revealed that he had spent an entire day signing Clerks movie memorabilia together with Anderson and Jason Mewes (Jay). This reunion allowed them to patch things up, and provided him with so much inspiration that he immediately threw away the old script, and started working on a new one with ideas that Anderson was receptive to. According to Smith, it will be \"a movie that concludes a saga [...] about how you're never too old to completely change your life [...] about how a decades-spanning friendship finally confronts the future.\"",

You can get a wound that doesn't kill you. A bullet goes through your lung and you can walk around, but the air is leaking out of your lung every time you breathe, so your own breathing can kill you, because your own breathing will crush your organs. It will turn into a balloon in there, and they have to puncture it to let the air out. So he told me those two things, and I said, 'God, that's never been in a movie. I'd like to do that.'\"",

The movie also utilized both Shivanna and SriiMurali's strengths to perfection. The movie did take some cinematic liberties with the comedy and romance track which did affect the pace of the movie. After almost 7 years Narthan comes back with a more crisper narration through the prequel Bhairathi Ranagal.Bhairathi Ranagal delivers almost everything that it promises from the promotion material that one would have already seen so far. The story is about the origin and rise of the gangster Bhairathi Ranagal which we saw in Mufti and is well built. The first half takes some time to create an arc for the main character which leads to a powerful interval fight sequence. The second half of the movie focuses on the growth of the character and the empire that he builds. The action sequences are more gruesome than Mufti and are gracefully handled for Shivarajkumar's age. The art direction and camerawork stand out for most parts. The dialogues are very well written and there are some really clever one liners which I hadn't heard in Kannada cinema for a long time. The movie shows some exceptional quality showing some strong symbolic references with respect to main character's costume, his reading habits and some elements from its previous movie, Mufti. However the movie is drawn back by the lacklustre background score. Apart from the main theme, most part of the action sequences feel less impactful because of the music. The movie also lacks a challenging negative character especially in the second half. The movie does not create the same emotional impact in the second half as compared to the first. This movie also suffers from a hurried climax just like Mufti.Shivanna is the core of the film and he gives it all by underplaying Bhairathi Ranagal's character to perfection. He delivers some of the most impactful dialogues at ease which work really well for this movie. However apart from Shivanna and a gangster role in the first half almost every other supporting character isn't well written. The movie could have been done without Rukmini Vasanth's character or they could have brought in a different actor for the role that is. Rahul Bose tries his best to look menacing but is let down by weak writing.I personally feel that this movie deserved a bigger scale and more time for Shivarajkumar's stardom and this kind of concept. While this may not disappoint, this movie would have been more suitable for a release before Mufti as we are used to the bigger movies and more exciting rivalries in recent times.",

I do wish I could've seen it in theaters just for personal satisfaction, but I rented it on Amazon and will buy the Blu-Ray in the future.Probably one of the more serviceable films I've watched recently. It's certainly not unwatchable, but there's some acting that just seems goofy, the whole movie feels weirdly disconnected though and it doesn't feel like some scenes really make any impact. Both main characters are genuinely insufferable for the first 2/3rds of this movie and then they suddenly start to get along. It does have some surprising emotional moments that Work. Generally I wouldn't recommend to watch it unless you're an Uwe Boll fan like me. There's a stinger for a part two eventually which I mean, sure? I'd watch it I guess.",

Mou filmed the movie in Harbin, Manchuria where 731 was stationed. He used 731's real headquarters as a location, it was a school at the time of the shoot. When Mou took down the school's name and put the Japanese flag back, it horrified the local elderly who had lived through the war. One particularly upset old lady approached Mou and his crew and said \"I knew they'd be back (the Japanese), I just hoped it wouldn't be this soon!\"",

Likewise, Toko's story was written down more than two hundred years later, in the epic tale \"Gesta Danorum\".Many historians view William Tell as a purely legendary figure, though his story was deeply embedded in Swiss national identity by the time of its writing.",

The press was fitted with foam pads (which resemble the casting molds in the press) and there were chocks put in the center to stop it from closing completely. However, the machine was powerful enough to crush the chocks that it gradually kept closing. It is commonly believed that Finley pulled his head out of the press just in time to avoid being injured, and that his scream in that scene was genuine, but this is an exaggeration. Finley was quickly pulled out by grips and the record press scene, along with most scenes in the movie with little dialogue, was filmed without sound, and the talking and sound effects were dubbed in later. At a Phantom of the Paradise convention, Finley exaggerated the story and said that his scream was \"for real\", although he may have meant that he was able to conjure up a very real scream in post-production by thinking back to his memories of the incident.",

Maurer and Witlin never gave up hope or faith in the film and continued year after year after year to find the financing to make this movie. After getting constant rejections, Maurer and Witlin finally found interest from Lionsgate UK and Embankment to finance based on an extensive rewrite that Maurer authored in collaboration with Tim Prager, whom Maurer hired. Maurer and Witlin then used this new draft to get commitments from Smith, Bates and Linney. In addition, Maurer and Witlin then hired director Thaddeus O'Sullivan and UK producer Chris Curling and together they brought on and hired Irish producers ShinAwil and BCP.

Although the experiment's purpose is not explicitly mentioned in the film, the original study was meant to observe the effects of power, rules, group identity and dehumanization in a simulated prison environment. The Stanford prison experiment also employed test subjects as either guards of prisoners, but ended early as both groups took their respective roles too seriously. The experiment will never be redone, because although it was deemed ethical at the time under the later-amended rules of the American Psychiatric Association, any research done must not physically or mentally harm the participants.",

There was no Central Committee comprised of Communist Party and KGB men above the two (this was a plot device created for the film to show Soviet bureaucratic methods) and the main reason why the case took so long was that the investigators interviewed over 150,000 people trying to narrow down who the killer could be.

The original script was discarded and there were at least seven subsequent rewrites. Pitt said the final version was \"a mess\". \"The script that I had loved was gone,\" he said. \"I guess people just had different visions and you can't argue with that. But then I wanted out and the studio head said, 'All right, we'll let you out, but it'll be $63 million for starters.\" (Harrison Ford later noted that Pitt \"forgot for a moment that he was talking to someone whose job it was to write this s*** down\".)",

The filming was split into two blocks; first to shoot scenes where Foreman is at his prime and later for when he's in his forties. The crew took six weeks off so Khris Davis could bulk up for the latter part of the filming. Davis had pretty strict instructions on how many calories to eat per day, depending on his training regime, but the actor went above and beyond, consuming 7000 calories a day to gain the necessary weight. He went from 225 to 275 in six weeks eventually ending up at around 282.",

Tech City (former IBM HQ) in the town of Ulster was rented for months as the qualified production facility and for administrative office space. Over 4,400 rooms were booked at regional hotels and the local spend was north of $13 million. Locations were used throughout the region thanks to the talent of (location manager) Kurt Enger and his crew, including Myna Joseph. Featured locations in the film were found in Millerton, Red Hook, Tivoli, Kingston, Palenville, and Ulster, in Dutchess and Ulster Counties NY.",

Most of the filming was completed after Jacobson work hours.",

Many specific locutions used by the men in the movie can be found as cited, for instance, in Gitta Sereny's book \"Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth\" as well as other sources.

In Mamannan, while there weren't as many traumatic moments, and there were some pauses between heavy scenes, there still weren't enough contrasting or lighter moments.However, in Vaazhai, these issues are not present. The screenplay includes some well-placed relief moments that allow the audience to slow down and regain energy before the trauma hits again.After seeing Director Bala become emotional after watching this movie, I prepared myself for an intense emotional ride. Perhaps because I was expecting something overwhelming, I found that the movie wasn't as distressing or saddening as I anticipated. The film primarily addresses capitalist ideologies, and it is well-made, brilliantly portrayed, and effectively showcased.",

The running joke of the urn with ashes in it wore thin after a while, but it managed to resolve itself with a few shedding of tears. The humour I did laugh at was mainly to do with dialogue, which I kind of understand ( badly all the same ) as after many years living there I could not and still do not quite get it!!! Shame on me. The story itself is basically the usual and rather tiresome I have just got out of my nappies film, which is a trope in Gay/Queer cinema I wish we could drift away from for a while. Two ( teenage ? ) guys meet cute by one of the dreariest landscapes in the world, and after a few bumpy rides in the relationship all's well that meets well. Mothers dominate yet again, and so do grandmothers as well as anyone else you want to mention in families. Their stories were sometimes moving, and sometimes full of cliches but the acting was overall good and the film is very watchable. I give it a 7 for being entertaining and at times manipulatively moving, but did Josha Stradowski as the tall youthful hunk from homosexual land really have to dominate quite so much with his skimpy shorts and teasing overtures of masturbation ? I am fond of male beauty but I am sick and tired of Gay cinema being overwhelmed by mainly young men of say under 22. There is a whole wide world out there of other gay male imagery to be explored, and some films do, and believe it or not, the male Lolita syndrome wears thin. I have said probably the unsayable, and perhaps the ' other ' portrayals ' of men are less popular with those who buy these films. Gay/Queer film still has many battles to fight to win over audiences, and that is sad but it does not have to remain in a world of sea bathing, shower scenes and titillation to gain attention. I like real sexuality in Gay cinema and have often applauded it, but the domination of youthful angst can become boring. That said I think this is the best gay themed film to come out of the Netherlands and that is to be celebrated.",

I felt I couldn't end inside the brothel but needed a contrast.

The film's budget of 4 million Euros may seem modest by U. S. standards, but it represents a significant investment in Finland.The story follows a young peasant woman who is married to a man she hardly knows and relocates to a secluded island. Although her new surroundings are initially unwelcoming, Maja quickly adapts and develops feelings for her husband, Janne. Portrayed by Amanda Jansson and Linus Troedsson, their characters evolve from strangers to a loving couple, gradually discovering intimacy. Their tender moments add a lighthearted touch to the film.Lymi's direction is evident in every scene, skillfully balancing tension with genuine interactions that resonate with viewers. The performances are outstanding, particularly Amanda Jansson's compelling portrayal of Maja, which draws the audience into her emotional journey. Linus Troedsson enriches the narrative as her husband, contributing to a well-rounded cast that amplifies the film's emotional depth.The cinematography is exceptional, beautifully capturing the wild beauty of stormy seas and rugged cliffs, which serve as a metaphor for Maja's inner turmoil. The musical score enhances the visuals, elevating the emotional stakes and fully immersing the audience in the narrative.\"Stormskerry Maja\" transcends mere filmmaking; it delves into themes of human connection, bravery, and the restorative power of nature. It leaves viewers feeling hopeful and inspired, making it essential viewing for anyone who values poignant storytelling. Tiina Lymi has crafted a true masterpiece that will linger in the hearts of audiences long after the film concludes. Highly recommended!",

We still suffer because of this past dictator, even the ones born after the revolution.Now I see the importance of going back 'there' to remind us not to repeat the same mistakes.Very emotional film for the entire sold-out cinema hall...

Amongst the better features here is the films' straightforward attempt at being a creature feature which is pretty much relegated to the second half of the film. Employing a heavy body-horror aspect that showcases a character slowly being turned from a regular person into a deformed alien creature slowly over the course of the film serves this one quite well as there's a lot of fun to be had with the slow-burn nature of his change into this type of creature. The practical effects-work used here is also quite effective, helped along by the use of the creatures' appearances in the second half as the concurrent discoveries about the existence of the alien race and their plan to stop the impending war about to happen that gives it all a rather fun series of connections that are rather nice to see play. That said, there are a few flaws within this one that bring it down. The main detriment of the film is a wholly overcomplicated and confusing storyline that has the central setup of a workable genre effort but crams way too much into it for its own good. The idea of the strange device harboring a means of stopping an impending alien invasion that's being recorded around the world and their quest to solve it is a fine enough idea but it's wasted on a series of draining sequences filled with overly-complicated measures trying to get it to work that there's a lot of issues brought up with how all over the place it is. Other setups here, including the alien's presence on Earth and the origins of the invasion around the planet, are just as awkward which leaves everything quite complicated and difficult to follow. The other factor with this one is a rather sluggish and dragged-out pacing that tends to drag the film to a halt during the middle with its lack of action. A large part of the film's middle section is the rather pedestrian investigation angle that looks into the strange encounters but that occurs so slowly as these scenes are done in conjunction with the sibling relationship being strained and mended the entire time. While there are scenes with the one character doing the changeover during this time, it's not enough to offset the lack of action this whole thing brings about a dragged-down tempo where not a lot happens to keep the viewer invested in what's going on. The other issue here is that there's not a whole lot of genuine genre feel throughout here, with the sci-fi heavy nature of a lot of the scenes here that carries more of a sci-fi bent which might not be that enjoyable for some but overall isn't as big a deal as the other factors.Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Graphic Language.",

For this reason, Bryant planned a workout program that would help him maintain his strength through the longer NBA seasons (a major adjustment, as Kobe went straight from high school to the pros). After Bryant consequently turned the movie role down, noting that the summer of 1997 was too important to spend time making the film, Lee promptly sought out Ray Allen, who quickly accepted the lead role.",

Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone, Julianne Moore and Diane Lane were offered the role, but they all passed on the opportunity. Marion Cotillard and Carice van Houten were also considered. Paul Verhoeven later revealed that when Isabelle Huppert heard of the plans to adapt the book, she called around to express her interest in the project; when she landed the lead role, she requested that Verhoeven be asked to direct. After producer Saïd Ben Saïd sent Verhoeven a copy of the book by Philippe Djian, his interest was immediately piqued, and fortunately, Verhoeven and Huppert were fans of each other's work and had wanted to work together for a long time, so his participation was quickly secured. It was then decided to relocate the shoot of Elle to France, since there would be no American lead and no American company was willing to produce such a controversial film. Verhoeven also claimed that most actresses who had previously been approached immediately turned down the part as soon as they had read the script, instead of waiting for a few days, which is standard practice. One of the actresses said that she felt uncomfortable because of things that had happened to her in the past, and another didn't give any reasons but just said \"certainly not\". Verhoeven also told The Guardian that the only American actress he thought would have been game was Jennifer Jason Leigh (with whom he worked in Flesh+Blood (1985)): \"She would have had absolutely no problem. She's extremely audacious. But she's an artistic presence and we were looking for names\". Although Huppert had difficulties relating to her character, Verhoeven was exceptionally pleased with her performance, stating that she brought things to the role beyond what was written in the script, and that it was her film from the beginning, since he had only joined the project much later on her insistence.",

I made my partner drive with me upstate, and we spent New Year's bumming around Saugerties quietly, mapping out the path and figuring out exactly how to time it so that I could start filming at 11:57 and hit the center of town right as the countdown actually began. It really was this 'You get one shot' sort of deal.\nI had gone to an Airbnb up in Saugerties over New Year's a couple years earlier. I was sick as a dog, spent that entire weekend lying around feeling terrible and didn't leave this Airbnb for three days except at midnight. I staggered out, went to the town and saw this very charming, small-town version of the Times Square ball drop. After I saw that, I was like, 'I need to work that into a movie someday.' The idea that Casey would be there filming was one of the early ideas for this film. The loneliness of being in a crowd of people and feeling like you can say whatever you want because no one is listening, or is even aware you're there, is a big part of that scene. Also, so many of the kids hanging around half a block away from the center of that party we were filming WERE Casey. It was like, 'Oh yeah, there are Caseys EVERYWHERE in towns like this.'\"",

He thus demonstrated the other alleged Vermeers were also fake and was charged with forgery and fraud, a much lesser offense than collaboration with the enemy. He was hence never sentenced to death, just to one year imprisonment.Joseph Piller arrested van Meegeren but did not act as his attorney.Van Meegeren was jailed in May 1945, released in Jan. or Feb. 1946 (after finishing the above-mentioned painting) and stood trial in Oct. and Nov. 1947. He was not detained in the attic of Goudstikker art gallery but mainly in the nearby HQ of Military Command.He did not sign his book for Hitler. However, according to the book the movie is partly based on, van Meegeren was a fascist sympathizer and did send an admiring note to Hitler in 1942.There are many exaggerations about characters and situations, notably Piller's and Dekker's methods as well as the feud between the Military and the Ministry of Justice.",

What starts as members of a drama troupe in Kerala casually spending a night partying at a patron's guesthouse quickly turns into a whodunnit crime drama with solid attention to detail. Stories are often just that.. stories. Lies are built upon lies. Selflessness gradually turns into pretense and selfishness. The crime happens to the only female member of the troupe. A version of her story is conveyed to all the remaining male members. There's so much intricacy in the storytelling, so much candidness. The writing (dialogues, especially) is superlative.The decision to cast a bunch of (fantastic) newcomers except for the three (or four) main characters turns out to be a masterstroke. This way, it's easy to perceive each one of them objectively, along with their perspectives of what happened that night. Amongst the menfolk of the troupe, we see almost every variant of men there is. Or at least, fascinating shades of it. Some are old-fashioned, some are suspicious of their female colleague's demeanor, some find it hard to believe her story, and some have selfish motives. They exhibit differential shades of misogyny without even realizing it. The wronged woman (Zarin Shihab) continues to be at the receiving end of it all. She silently takes it in; there's no outburst or excessive display of emotion. Shihab is spectacular, and I liked the writer-director's choice to end the film purely from her perspective.All the performers have done a wonderful job, pushing their respective roles to even greater heights. Vinay Forrt, especially, is amazing as the conflicted boyfriend with his own set of personal and professional dilemmas. The screenplay was so immersive that I didn't pay a lot of attention to the other departments (cinematography, music) and I'm going to rewatch this for the complete package when it becomes available to stream digitally. For now, Malayalam cinema couldn't have asked for a better start to 2024.",

Tinti starred with Gemser in all of her Emanuelle films, except for Emanuelle Around the World (1977). She admitted once that it was strange that they both had such a strong bond despite performing in several graphic sex scenes with other actors.",

Some of these cut and never included in any official version scenes include shots of Indian women's breasts being sliced off and thrown around; children's limbs graphically severed (real amputees were employed for these shots); a little girl's legs cut off by wagon wheels; a soldier gleefully cutting an Indian's arms off before shooting another Cheyenne in the eye; the fate of Spotted Wolf, who is beheaded and his head is hoisted as a trophy by a soldier before he tosses it to another soldier, who then throws it off camera. Spotted Wolf's head attached to the stirrup of a cavalryman was not cut and is shown in the release print, and there are stills showing his mutilated body lying on the ground without the head and four cavalrymen running around with his severed head in their hands, howling and laughing while blood is spurting from the neck stump.",

However some time before release the film was cut down in order to tone it down and attract more wider audience. This is also why most of Alexandra Daddario's nude scenes were heavily cut down. For example, originally the \"sex montage\" was longer and it showed her character having rough sex with more men and it also included some topless scenes from her. Despite the rumors there never was any full frontal or lesbian scenes filmed with her. Reportedly, original cut was about 45 minutes longer than final version.

Making the casts, which involved being submerged in the very hot casting material with only a straw in their mouths to breathe through, was grueling for the actors, especially Carolyn Jones, who was claustrophobic. Dana Wynter recalled, \"I was in this thing while it hardened, and of course it got rather warm! I was breathing through straws or something quite bizarre, and the rest of me was encased, it was like a sarcophagus. The guys who were making it tapped on the back of the thing and said, 'Dana, listen, we won't be long, we're just off for lunch [laughs]!' In the end, we had to be covered except for just the nostrils and I think a little aperture for the mouth.\"",

After that, the team was sold again and put on exhibit as a curiosity. The dogs were abused, neglected, and forgotten until a Cleveland businessman named George Kimbal, with the help of Cleveland school children, bought the six remaining dogs for the then-astounding sum of $2,000, which they raised in two weeks. The dogs were brought to the Cleveland Zoo and lived out their lives in peace. When Balto died in 1933, he was stuffed and displayed in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",

In 2002 during a free dive in the Dominican Republic, Mestre drowned while surfacing from underwater, as her surfacing device malfunctioned. Following her death, the media strongly suggested Ferreras to be the perpetrator, as he might have interfered the device in order to kill her. He was even arrested for questioning, but was later released. In No Limit, Mestre and Ferreras' story is loosely adapted into a drama between estranged couple Pascal Gautier and Roxane Aubrey. In the film, Pascal is an abusive husband of Roxane who is jealous of her successful career in free diving, something he is not perfect at. The film strongly suggests at the finale that he sabotaged Roxane's breathing device that causes her to drown underwater while surfacing, similar to the death of Audrey Mestre in real life. At the end of the film, an obituary dedicated to Mestre is shown.Following the release of the film, Mestre's widower Ferreras filed a defamation lawsuit against Netflix for blaming him for Mestre's death, as the film claimed to be \"inspired by true events\". In response, director David M. Rosenthal said that the film was a work of fiction and had no similarities with real life whatsoever.",

Colvin had many friends in London, but none of them were similar to the Bridget Jones-style girlfriend character (portrayed by Nikki Amuka-Bird) in the film. Her last boyfriend was not a caring and loving Stanley Tucci but rather a man who gave her immense heartache and distress. There were no 'heads on sticks' in Bosnia, as the character meant to be Colvin's first husband, Patrick Bishop, says in one of the opening scenes (heads were on sticks in Chechnya). Colvin's second husband, Juan Carlos Gumucio, is erased from the script altogether, though he played an important role in her life.\" Although positive about Rosamund Pike's performance, she recommends that her readers watch the documentary Bearing Witness (2005) instead.",

It follows Eladio who works as the groundskeeper of a hunting estate owned by the powerful Don Francisco. After taking a bribe from a local hunter, Eladio's normal life falls apart, plunging him into the depths of guilt, hatred, and revenge.A pretty well executed Spanish slow burner that definitely deserve some attentions from then genre fans.",

I read the book a couple of years ago so knew the subject matter would be difficult but I had no idea it would be captured so well and acted so beautifully for the stage. The weaving in and out of Jude's past experiences and present day was very well presented and so well done for the stage. The lighting, live orchestra and camera work plus close ups make this so transferable to the big screen that I hardly noticed the audience. Utterly powerful, tragic, poignant, funny at times and true to the book - in my opinion sometimes better. James Norton has surpassed himself in this, he is compelling to watch, and the rest of the cast were excellent with not one weak performance. This is not a play to see if you are squeamish or shy away from gritty subjects. I don't want to add more to give spoilers so I'll just say this - see it for the performances if you are a genuine fan of acting/theatre. The performances will stay with me for a long time.",

These are honestly talented actors, and some are extremely good looking, but need to show more one-on-one interactions, thoughts, feelings etc. They are there but in very minute quantities.",

However, the movie was sold to Lionsgate Premiere, which thought it had been sold a Keanu Reeves cop thriller. During the editing process, Lionsgate Premiere changed the story's focus to center on Reeves' character, and changed the movie into a generic crime-thriller. Gee Malik Linton wrote and directed the film, but since Lionsgate Premiere and the producers edited the film without his approval, The Directors Guild of America (DGA) allowed him to take his name off the credits. He is still listed as writer, but his directing credit is listed as \"Declan Dale\".",

Tommaso Basili has his head in hands and I swear, you can see him thinking, why did I take this role???So the story, plausible, but so much useless information was added, scenes that set up nothing an informed no one of anything - just pointless.The real crac:\nit takes 60 mins to get to the story. Then 30 to setup and 5 to finish. All the wrong way round.Was this a thriller or a horror? Make up was laughable - demons and monsters and religion.Poor rehash of old material and the co-stars were left with rubbish lines and missed opportunities.I learned nothing new except that random use of angled camera shot annoys everyone - saved gimmicks for meaningful story events.",

The principal \"real-life role\" in the movie is Ben Sliney, the FAA's National Operations Manager, who made the decision on 9/11 to shut down all air traffic operations in the United States. Sliney had just been promoted to the National Operations Manager position, and September 11, 2001 was his first day on the job. That explains the applause from the FAA flight monitors when he walks into the control center in Herndon, VA, at the beginning of the movie. Several officials who were with Sliney in the FAA control room on 9/11 play themselves, including Tobin Miller, Rich Sullivan, and Tony Smith. In the scenes at Newark Airport, several air traffic controllers who were in the Newark control tower on 9/11, and who witnessed the air attacks on the World Trade Center, play themselves. At the air traffic monitoring centers in Boston, New York, and Cleveland, the air traffic monitors are all played by real-life air traffic controllers, including several who were at these locations on 9/11, and who monitored the hijacked flights. At the Northeast Air Defense Command Center (NEADS) in Rome, NY, most of the military personnel are played by real-life military air traffic controllers, including several people, notably Major James Fox, who were at NEADS on 9/11. Also, on United Flight 93, the actors playing the pilots in the movie are real-life airline pilots, and the flight attendants are played by real-life flight attendants, some of whom work for United Airlines.",

However, in viewing a rough cut in November 1950, producer Howard Hughes had a change of heart, deciding that Communists were more of a menace than crazed Nazi scientists (it was also the height of the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" era) and ordered extensive re-shooting in November and December 1950 and May 1951, with the villains now becoming former Nazis but current Communists.",

That's the last time I ever cared about a movie because I went to the press screening and it was like getting kicked in the stomach, seeing what is not there.

The movie does not tell us, but this was Moe Berg's second trip to Japan. In 1932, he and a couple other American players were recruited to come teach American-style baseball to the Japanese. Berg, who had a gift for languages, taught himself passable Japanese on the ship while on the way over. Early in the cruise, one of his fellow players asked if he could speak Japanese and Berg said \"No\". Once they got to Japan, they were astounded to find him speaking the language. One of them said \"I thought you couldn't speak Japanese?\" He replied, \"That was two weeks ago.\"",

Flawless acting and the development of characters that are hard not to get attached to. An excellent script that consciously - with a maturity rarely seen among debuts - avoids the beaten paths of drama. The director hints at them and then consistently leads us down a different route. The reality of this film is far from the black-and-white simplifications to which decades of patriarchal narrative have accustomed us. Here, the woman is the subject. Beautiful cinema, unbelievable debut. 10/10.",

There was nothing interesting happening in the narrative, and the pacing of the movie was sluggish and dull. And it didn't help one bit that there was so many names being tossed about casually, making it difficult to keep track of who was who, and what their agendas were.The cast ensemble in the movie was good, I will give the movie that much. Just a darn shame that the actresses and actors virtually had next to nothing to work with in terms of script, storyline, character gallery and dialogue.\"Ribolbeo\" was a boring swing and a miss of a movie. And running at 114 minutes, I only made it 40 minutes in, I can honestly say that I was bored senseless, and I have zero intentions of returning and attempting to watch the rest of the movie, despite the fact that there were some good names on the cast list.My rating of this boring crime drama lands on a three out of ten stars.",

The plot is very simple and kinda confused what is actually the ending part it has like 2 or 3 emotional scene but dont actually end there.There is a creditor who i thought it was a main antagonist and it will end like the protagonist doesn't know aboth hidden interest or something in contact but he just pay it all and the Debt story just end there.Another is a conflict with ghost gf is that she a ghost and he cannot touch her, i don't know why they just accept and then process to act like yeah we can live like this. Like elemental by Pixar has same story like this and then make story go on to slove this. But this movie is build different. It make me when i watching this thing is not a movie at all everything that build up is just there no finish or final drama.And everything isn't make sense like. Main characters is a streamer in start and loan a money after inheritance that he doesn't receive to anything buying a new pc setup. This was to build a stroy for later but it just end at half of the movie.The ending part is just so peak not gonna lie ( not the dancing ). Very cleavers writing a sudden shash without warning plus the past story of Anong scene it just make ending confused why do they put it in there idk. But overall the ending it just so bizarre that make audience can't predict it. It not carry the whole movie btw just another Thai romance comedy with Traditional Thai CGI and character design.",

According to The Hollywood Reporter, EuropaCorp's president, Luc Besson, wanted to shift the story's focus to the rescue mission rather than the politics behind the disaster. One theory is that nobody at EuropaCorp wanted to be hacked. \"Remember The Interview (2014)?\" a source said, referring to the Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen-directed comedy that angered Kim Jong-un and is believed to have sparked the infamous Sony hack in 2014. Ironically, the Russian leader is sympathetically portrayed in the original Kursk script, which highlighted why he took the tragedy personally (Putin's father was a submariner).",

All, but literaly ALL women characters were all the time with perfect make up (even when waking up in bed) perfect hair style (even when going doing things in kitchen), on high heels (even during the day in their own houses). Although they are all from some middle upper class, and not from aristocratic level, all interiors, even in cottages, were like from 'Home and Garden' magazines with pristine care that every item is on it's place ready for photo shooting.

Larry Gordon [Lawrence Gordon] had a terrible script set in a prison. Stallone calls James Woods and asks if I'm any good as a director. Woods says yeah, he's a good director and you ought to work with him. So we have a director and a star, but no script. All we have is a theme - a guy escaping from prison. So we hire Jeb Stuart, who was then one of the hottest writers in Hollywood, to rewrite the script and we go off looking for prison locations. Now we have a star, a theme, a shooting date, a budget, a studio, but we still have no script. So we all go back to New York City, and move into a hotel where Larry 'tortures' Jeb and Henry Rosenbaum into writing a script in record time. Meanwhile, I'm going around scouting prisons. We finally found one in Rahway, New Jersey. Jeb and Henry were writing the script as we were making the movie. New pages would come in every day. There was one day when I was on the third tier of a cell-block in Rahway Penitentiary and I had nothing to shoot. I had my movie star, all these extras and a great location - and the pages were on their way. So we sat around and bullshitted with the prisoners. Stallone is a smart guy and a very underrated actor. If I ever needed a better line, he'd come up with one. Stallone is a really hard worker. I had no problem whatsoever with him\".",

Rackin obliged and lied to Ford, telling him that Wayne's teeth were beginning to show up yellow on film and that he needed to take both Wayne and William Holden to New Orleans to have their teeth cleaned.

If it had been made in the West without the Red Army's assistance, it would have cost 3 times as much. To recreate the battlefield, the Soviets bulldozed 2 hills, deepened a valley, laid miles of roads, transplanted 5,000 trees, sowed fields of rye, barley, and wildflowers, and reconstructed 4 historic buildings.

What will you show next? And then the filmmaker would have to outdo himself by showing more. So there was this escalation of violence and sensuality. After my generation, you know what happened? The sexy films became movies with penetration. I don't do that stuff, mine is just simulated. After that, they have to outdo themselves. The filmmakers, the producers and the move-going public wanted to see more. So they have to discover even younger actresses in the street, discover lesser stars, and the actresses became like toilet paper. That's how they (the producers) described them - tissue paper. Use them once and then throw them away. Use them for one to two films - they haven't even recovered money yet to buy themselves a car, and they are already out of the industry. And then they'll get a fresher face, younger. So my contemporaries were a decade younger than me. Because I was in my mid twenties when I was doing the sexy films, and the other films, the lead star is fifteen years old! You know, I was a middle aged woman, and my span of being a sexy star was up to one decade. I was in the industry so long, and there was a huge turnover of actresses. I outlasted them. But I told you, I have a supporting cast who will do all of the worst scenes. And since I'm the blockbuster drawer, I'm the crowd drawer in the film, they capitalize on my name, they listen to my ground rules.\"",

I truly honestly sincerely from the bottom of my hate kids with a passion but this one takes the cake! To think the elite baby eaters have missed their chance to make pot roast out of and consume this one. I kid, I kid!All jokes aside I was so angry at her when I found out she was selling her parents items in the garage sale she made herself and that's when I wanted to hit her. I hated so much, on her the next scene she gets run over by a car and I could not stop laughing with glee and clapping, so happy I was; anyway I have no idea if they kill off her character but I hope so.Also seeing a grown man cry and seeing a toll free number written in big taking 1/8 of the television screen made me think this is a religious film sure; enough people are randomly start having religious fits and that made me even more angry thinking I could be living peacefully in Utah, if it weren't for those religious freaks who ring your doorbell when you're trying to sleep after a long hard week of non-stop work; now that's one state where murder should be made legal for that very reason, but I digress. I mean a kid... or am I?4/10 because it is well filmed and I love dandelions. They should have titled it 'dandelions'. From what I watched, the film did not took place in the snow, to be called Summer Snow. I did however see the snow come down in June like Vanessa Williams sings it when I lived in the mountains. Show's over and I have no idea whether the brat croaked or not. For the life of me I will never understand people who enjoy crying and love melodrama! People: you will attract more misery into your lives because that is what you love, in life always brings you what you love and this is the most important spiritual lesson you will ever learn, more than the silliness this film purported to teach you with their Christian mythology.",

There's a moment when she looks and sees bats going into the tree and you could think that maybe there's something in there, in the same way that bats were apparently the reason that COVID-19 kicked in. There are little references like that but image of a single tree in this sort of muddy little swamp to me was really creepy and intriguing and asks a lot of questions. There are little subtle things like there's a moment in the beginning when you see a picture from the people who lived in this house like a hundred years ago and it's the same tree but that tree is in blossom and alive, so it's died over the years and maybe it's become this kind of place where bad stuff lives. I would like to keep a little mystery in the story. I think the best kind of horror lives in between spots and it's not overly explained because if you over explain the monster then the monster loses its power to scare you. We did at one point flirted with the idea of seeing something in there like seeing a humanoid shape but I just felt in the end it's more interesting to let the audience ask that question whether they have an answer to it or not. There had to be a kind of reason why this kid gets infected, some sort of explanation, but you don't want to go too far with that, at least in my mind. I think it's better to have a little ambiguity in the story.\"",

That says a lot on the movie.The atmosphere feels wierd, beeing placed in Sweden and all. The plot covers a lot of things the audience dont know anything about, for instance Per Gessle´s dads condition.Whats is good about the movie? A lot of music for sure. Gyllene Tider (translated to english, Golden times) is/was a great band with high-quality musicians on all positions. Many of the members good producers too. For Gyllene Tider-fans, check this out, but do not have any risen expectations regarding the acting.",

Should I bring it for the production? Maybe we could use it.' We knew immediately how that would fit into our general approach to the photography of the movie. The photography should feel like an omniscient presence in the movie. It should feel very subjective, almost like a third, all-powerful character. So Will came out with the drone and, after almost getting arrested with it in a Moscow airport because they were thinking it was a piece of military equipment he was going to assault Russia with, we got to use it. Any day the crew was off, [co-director/cinematographer] Aaron Moorhead and I would continue to shoot. On Sundays in Italy, we'd continue shooting and that was when we'd do the drone photography with Will. Just grab as many shots as we could, experiment with it, see how it would work. And almost everything we shot with the drone made it into the edit. It's one of the talking points of the movie. It's pretty cool. It's one of those things where one day, because a lot of people have started using them and someday people are going to look at our movie and be like, 'Why did Moorhead and Benson use the fucking toy helicopter thing over and over and over again?'\"[2014]",

This was due to the disappointing box-office performance in France and the criticism (by, among others, Variety critic Todd McCarthy) of the film as being too violent and often incoherent. The French press were scathing of this 'American censorship' (they described the film as having been 'given a face-lift' for American audiences), but the new version was defended by various French critics being both more coherent whilst also maintaining Chereau's artistic vision. The shorter cut was later released in France too, in the hopes of increasing the film's box-office takings. 20 years later, Chereau slightly re-edited his film again and re-mastered it for a new BluRay release with a running time of 161 minutes. This was one of Chereau's last completed acts before his untimely death, so it can be regarded as the definitive version.",

But the movie is not about steamy dreams/fantasies - neither yours nor hers. It is a mechanism - a distraction! A force shield if that comparison works even better for you.So being spoiled and not sure what to do with herself (or the body god has given her), she also is being taken from this world ... well still on planet Earth, but quite a remote location, where she isn't even able to reach any of her friends. It is never clear if they are actual friends or just random people on social media she has gotten to know.I guess you could read a few things into the movie. You could make up stuff that the makers intended or maybe they are your own version of whatever is transpiring. Anyway, this is a quest for self discovery ... accidental, by chance and a bit forced (parents pressuring her to take a trip with them) ... and finally also a bit of nudity.

However, this is definitely one of the better ones due to the quality of the sex scenes.Plot: Click on the plot summary link for a description. There's not really anything else to it as the plot is merely a device to introduce lots of sex scenes. It's rather short, and it's fairly easy to sit through due to relatively exciting topics like threesomes, voyeurism, etc.Acting: Christine Nguyena and Frank Mercuri are fine in this light drama. Katrina Isis and Jack Ketchmark are below average as always. And hardcore actress (and newcomer to softcore) Kelli Brooks is kinda lousy.Sex Scenes: The wraparound story contains three simulated sex scenes (not including a very brief bathtub solo by Kelli Brooks) using the credited actors, and these are very average. The real meat of this flick is the 15 inserted simulated sex scenes using uncredited actors. While many of the wraparound softcore flicks steal their sex scenes from old below average softcore shows (e.g. \"Kama Sutra\", \"Bedtime Stories\"), this flick uses newer (if not brand new) sex scenes that I don't recognize from a previous source. These sex scenes are consistently good or better, varied and creative, quite long, and are often more risqué than usual for softcore. I'd guess that the sex scenes in this flick take up more than 75% of the screen time.Women: None of the three girls in the wraparound story really float my boat, but the inserted scenes were a Who's Who of 2000's softcore, including many of my favorites. I spotted TJ Hart, Monique Alexander, Angela Davies, Beverly Lynne, Nicole Sheridan, Chloe, Wendy Rice, Sryen, Brooke Hunter, and Summer Fields along with others I didn't know.Overall... short and forgettable wraparound story that introduces lots and lots of rather good simulated sex scenes.",

Since this decision was made after the filming was completed, the movie has serious pacing and editing problems. But this problem does not occur when it is broadcast as a series. It was broadcast as a 6-part series on Prime Video Tr. If you have the opportunity, I suggest you watch it that way. There are also some additional scenes that are not in the movie.It is really a very labor-intensive, high-production and successful series. The acting is also very successful, but it is a production that is quite lacking in terms of history. Some incidents in Mustafa Kemal's life that are not certain take place in the production. There are also things that have been proven to be untrue. Although these are not too many, they attracted my attention as someone who knows the truth. Aras Bulut Iynemli (the lead role) gave a good performance, but it is questionable how appropriate he is for Mustafa Kemal. He is also made to look extremely tense and harsh. Although it is known that Mustafa Kemal was very angry in some situations, he was generally more calm and cool. Although the actor playing Enver Pasha is very good, Enver Pasha is also portrayed a bit inaccurately in the movie. If we ignore the historical mistakes and the projection of some characters, series was good. I would give it 8,2 or 8,3 out of 10. Since there is no such score on imdb, I gave 9 points by being completely emotional reasons.",

That is because the building in real life does not have an open rooftop. The rooftop in the top-down shot was digitally superimposed onto the real-life building. And the other rooftop scenes were shot on an entirely different building. (Also, in real life, the building is much larger than it would seem from that digital superimposition.)",

Sometimes, not even that. Even polish government started to make their own propaganda to make people believe it was anti-polish movie and all of that just so they could gain more voters before election that will happen soon. In some cities, it's even banned to be played in cinemas. That's how current government's world works and will work if they win again. No free speech, full censorship of anything that may be offensive towards government and many many more. But it's not about it.Movie itself is build on politics, so it's hard to not talk about them. Though, I don't think that Holland wanted to attack the army itself, as some of the people think she did, but rather the corruption and how government overused their power. How they forced people to act like there was no human rights, like those people on the other side of the fence were nothing. This movie isn't about letting illegal migrants into the country, but about respect and right treating. We're all humans after all, but what was happening on the border was really wrong.It's not a documentary, but a lot of things that happened in the movie had place in real life. There was a lot of videos, photos and even articles saying about those horrible things happening. And all of it just because of the government, who wants to make their own people scare and be afraid of other nationalities. Movie was also about our own feelings, how we see the world that surrounds us. It's always hard to say about things, that are uncomfortable, but true. But they have to be said and we can't just let those high positioned people get away with it without any consequences. That's not how this world should work.I was following the news back then and I'm really glad that such movie was made and is showing somehow the reality of what was happening on the border. But the truth is, what media were allowed to show us and what is the real truth of how it really looked like, is two different things and for people, who are open-minded those two things should matter to draw your own conclusions and based on that make your own opinion.",

After seeing how mom & two daughters acted why did they not ask the daughter for home entry or call the father,even social services instead just leave without follow-up.Even though towards the movies end you see remorse or more sorry she got caught,you didn't feel any sympathy only anger over Ruby's tears.Hope the kids recovered with time & frankly,would never trust Ruby over her decisions again & that Jodi never is allowed again to do this.Glad their social media was removed,such hypocritical or dangerous advice that leads to crimes never should be montenized.Worth checking out,but will upset you.",

The script had several scenes of Hauer's character Burns establishing his natural leadership by reminding the other hunters to abide by his rules. Originally, the dinner scene would be the moment where he puts Busey's character Doc back in his place. However, on the day of rehearsals, Busey came up with a two-page monologue about his dog that he wanted to try out. Hauer felt that Busey was obviously trying to steal his scene away by not giving him a chance to intervene in his monologue. So during the actual filming, Hauer improvised a quick response to the story by calling it \"bullshit\", which greatly confused Busey. However, Busey's delivery so impressed the director and the other actors that his monologue was kept in the final film, and Hauer's retort wasn't used.",

It's so sad.This anime inspired me , But with limited time, the movie is full of quotes to the point of seeming too stuffed.Competition between two tiny titans,I don't want to see a quick cut-off with Montage. Until their scores seemed meaningless, The tension between the matches disappeared. I only see friendship between competitors.The weight of the story places too much emphasis on Hinata and Kenma, to the point where it's like they're two people competing. Other characters are too kept out of the spotlight. There is even air time provided. But they's separated from Hinata and Kenma, only Kuroo still seems to be the highlight of the story sometimes.I understand that production on part 2 of the movie may have begun. Can you make an anime series as an extension. After making it into a movie version?I love this anime And thanks to all the team's efforts in creating it. I hope you agree with my opinion. Thank you so much.As for the visuals of this movie, I really liked Kenma's POV perspective. It gives us insight into what the Setter sees and makes decisions during play.I'm glad you enjoyed this race, Kenma.",

The Keaches then decided to turn the musical into a feature film screenplay in which both could star. In 1974, James was acting opposite Robert Carradine in The Hatfields and the McCoys (1975) and mentioned the project to him. Carradine suggested he and his brothers play the Younger brothers.

The film is narrated by one of the participants, Fritz Winken, a 12-year-old German child, who later in life lived in Honolulu and met with another of the protagonists, Sgt. Ralph Blank, who also survived the war, as did Pvt, James Rassi. Unfortunately, the fate of the rest of the people who are portrayed in the film is left unexplained by the narrative. However, a far more accurate version of the story is told by the real Fritz on an episode of the TV series Unsolved Mysteries, where he was able to reunite with all the soldiers.",

James A Marks, about his handling of the ship as she was entering the worst of the typhoon. Schultz implored Hull's XO, Lt. Greil Gerstley, an expert ship handler, to assume command but he refused citing fear of a court martial for mutiny. Other surviving witnesses on the bridge described Marks as paralyzed and indecisive, issuing questionable maneuvering orders, and declining to take on leveling ballast to help keep the ship upright after severe rolls, a decision his XO strongly disagreed with. A powerful gust exceeding 100 knots eventually rolled Hull over to her side and she did not recover. The ship flooded rapidly and 202 of her crew were lost. 62 others were subsequently rescued including Captain Marks. A board of inquiry did not find fault with Marks (none of the incidents on the bridge were brought up by anyone) but rather with Adm. Halsey for sending his fleet directly into the massive storm, although no disciplinary action was recommended. Some survivors of the Hull laid the blame for ship's loss exclusively on the Captain. James Marks committed suicide in 1986.",

She plays a flirtatious and scheming employee of a construction company, from whom she steals. She seduces a security guard, a fellow employee, and both co-owning brothers. There are several sex scenes with these partners. As a actress, she is a natural at playing this type of character. I hope to see her in future films.Arah Alonzo plays the wife of one of the co-owning brothers and does a fine job in a limited role. Arah is certainly worthly of starring in a lead role. Her best performance to date was in comedy-turned-tragedy Sex Games.Vivamax viewers will recognize actors Rash Flores and Mon Mendoza from past Vivamax films.The script is weak - certainly not of the quality of Vivamax's Stalkers. It's difficult for the actors to shine with weak scripts. I know Vivamax is working to get more film making talent in the stable to match its acting talent pool.The camera work and direction are good for a majority of the scenes, with a couple of exceptions in which there was poor blocking and poor lighting. The dim red light during sex scenes is overused.Welcome back Allison Smith!",

Their move to Levittown was marked with racist harassment and mob violence, which required intervention by state authorities. Despite this, the Myerses continued to face harassment for nearly three months. This led to some of the residents being charged and served an injunction. The Myers family received national attention and support. The Myers family eventually moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1961 after William Myers accepted a job offer in Harrisburg. He later died in 1987 at age 65. Daisy Myers later wrote an autobiography in 2005 about the experience titled 'Sticks 'N Stones: The Myers Family in Levittown'. She worked as a school teacher for the York School District for over 30 years. She was called the \"Rosa Parks of the North\". She died in 2011 at age 86. The news interviews that appear on TV in the film are from the actual citizens. They come from a documentary called \"Crisis In Levittown, PA\" from 1957. It can be found on Youtube.",

She is willing to risk all in this pursuit.Giulia (Fotini Peluso) is a young Italian woman who works in her century-old family business. Suddenly, her father (Mimmo Mancini) is in a serious automobile accident and lies in the hospital in a coma. Giulia, against the wishes of her mother (Manuela Ventura), tries unorthodox ways to save the business with the help of Kamal (Avi Nash).Sarah (Kim Raver) is a single mother and partner in a Montreal law firm. She has 10-year-old twin sons (Adrian and Dorian Doroslovac) and a struggling 16-year-old daughter, Hannah (Sarah Abbott). Sarah suddenly faces a crisis that sends her already hectic life over the top.\"The Braid\" is cleverly presented and emotionally compelling. Maelzer, Peluso, and Raver are all excellent, though Raver's character had believability script problems. Secondary characters are more forgettable or don't have enough time to develop. That's a problem with a two-hour movie telling three stories. Nonetheless, the film moved me, especially the story in India that resonated with the message of \"Origin,\" another film I've recently seen.",

When he returned, he found the leper had transformed into an angelic figure that identified himself as St. Lazarus. He said \"For your bravery and kindness, you will enjoy success as a warrior. You will win battles upon battles and never know defeat.\" In a nice nod to the legend, this movie contains a scene wherein the banished Rodrigo encounters a thirsty leper who begs a drink. After unhesitatingly offering his own pouch, the Leper thanks him by name. \"Who are you?\" asks Rodrigo. \"I am called Lazarus\", the leper answers.

Sightseers is one of my favourite films of all time. Lowe is also the writer and star of Prevenge , the gory and funny film about the unborn baby of Lowe's taking over the host and compelling her to do ghastly acts.So I think we know what to expect? Or do we?The film has been pushed by a plethora of free tickets, so I hope it isn't so bad that the free tickets are the only way to get bums on seats.Any way back to the film ... there was a lovely introduction by Alice herself, letting us all know that we could have a laugh if we wanted. Although the laughter wasn't compulsory she advised.The premise of the film is Lowe's quest for her one true love over time, alas her love is unrequited. Lowe coming to an ultimately end before her bequeathed was often aware.Jumping through the centuries, the 80s being the funniest with an Adam Ant lookalike being the object for Alice's affection. The actors throw a few good dance moves, name check to Propaganda's Duel sounding great over the cinemas sound system.There's some funny moments, but overall it's a bit disjointed and might work better as a tv series, featuring the time stalking over more detailed half hour segments.That said it does come across a bit like Highlander in its time travelling across time periods.Oh I forgot to say I did laugh a couple of times, initially after the first ghastly death, but it did peter out after that .Sorry Alice6/10.",

This is also clear to the German film director Matthias GLASNER, who was awarded the Silver Bear at the BERLINALE 2024 for his new film DYING. But he can add the North German Protestant variant to the theme, which further intensifies the familial melancholy.Lissy Lunies (Corinna HARFOUCH) and her husband Gerd (Hans Uwe BAUER) live in a small North German town and are already severely affected by old age. Accepting help is difficult for both of them. Their two children live far away and are badly hit by their own problems. Son Tom (Lars EIDINGER) lives in Berlin and is somewhat successful as a conductor, but is hopelessly entangled in private quarrels. Daughter Ellen (Lilith STANGENBERG) lives in Hamburg and is so committed to an alcohol-soaked lifestyle that she wakes up in Latvia after a night of drinking. It's true! Both are confronted in different ways with their parents' infirmity and their own inadequacies.The fact that the film doesn't get boring over its three-hour running time is thanks to the fantastic cast, which also includes Anna BEDERKE, Robert GWISDEK, Saerom PARK, Saskia ROSENDAHL and Ronald ZEHRFELD. The German actors Corinna HARFOUCH (EUROPEAN FILM AWARD Nominee 1989 for TREFFEN IN TRAVERS) and Hans Uwe BAUER have been awarded the GERMAN FILM AWARD of the year 2024 for their splendid performances. The showdown at the coffee table between HARFOUCH and EIDINGER is one of the most impressive things to have been seen in German cinema in recent years. The Lunies family is unhappy in their own way.A melancholy film from the German-speaking world! Haven't we seen enough of that already? Yes and no. Of course, as a cinema-goer you ask yourself whether this is typically German (or at least northern German) or whether it would be possible in other cultures. But Matthias GLASNER aims very high and takes his cues from cinema greats such as Ingmar BERGMAN and Federico FELLINI. After all, it's not for nothing that Tom Lunies prefers to watch the four-hour TV version of FANNY OCH ALEXANDER (1983) on Christmas Eve. And the character played by Robert GWISDEK (in real life, HARFOUCH's son) reminds me, at least, of Steiner played by Alain CUNY in LA DOLCE VITA (1959).Of course, depressing German cinema is not everyone's cup of tea. But the way the story is so close to reality has a very special impact that you should definitely expose yourself to.Clearly recommended!",

The adjoining cotton field was also purchased to make the crash appear bigger. 140 extras were employed for the scene along with 40 members of the Kern County and Bakersfield Fire Department. One of the town's main roads was closed for a week, and the local electricity company was persuaded to knock down several pylons and snarl up half a mile of electric cable to create a scene of almost total devastation. The crash site took a total of 10 days to prepare, and included throwing 600 suitcases and their contents (all items purchased from local thrift stores) liberally around the site.

I picked five or 10 scenes from the film, and they were kind of brilliant at both roles, as you can imagine. But there was just something about the quintessential Englishness that Colin brought to Sam and a kind gregarious energy that Stanley immediately brought to [the American] Tusker, which made the lighter moments in the film really sing. It just felt right all of a sudden.'\"",

Weaved through the story are Christian themes and parables, as well as flashbacks to how he and the girls lost their mother, and side stories of one of his daughters working on the school play, mean coworkers, and romance. The problem is that this is a very low budget, B - movie. Although filmed in 2023 it looks like it was filmed in the 70s or 80s. I hate to criticize the hard work, but the acting is very amateur, the writing/dialogue and directing are bad.That being said, it is a heartwarming Christian movie that the whole family can watch... I just don't think with the slow pace, dull colors, and lack of energy, that the younger family members will stick with it. Probably would've been better as a book IMHO!",

It was from this wellspring of grief and contemplation that the idea for \"Hanim\" (The Lady), a film steeped in the themes of ageing and solitude, took shape. Refig, also influenced by his wife's love for cats, her passion for music, and the isolation she experienced within her own world, decided that the film would be anchored by the presence of Yildiz Kenter, whom he had learned had suffered an accident from a television broadcast. Unfortunately, upon hearing Kenter's name, the producers were less than enthusiastic, and the film's production was delayed for many years.In 1988, shortly before filming commenced, Esref Kolçak fractured his toes in a traffic accident, yet he bravely carried on with his role in the film, his injury becoming an unexpected part of his character's physicality.Just last year, I had the opportunity to chat with Cem Özer backstage before a theatrical performance. When I mentioned that I had acquired the DVD of \"Hanim,\" he was incredulous, remarking, \"I didn't think anyone remembered that film anymore.\"Indeed, Turkish cinema is a repository of countless forgotten films and untold stories. Some films tell compelling tales, while others, like \"Hanim,\" are stories in and of themselves.With music by the legendary Cemal Resit Rey and Adnan Saygun, and cinematography by Çetin Tunca, \"Hanim\" stands as one of those exceptional and overlooked cinematic treasures.The film's narrative unfolds at a leisurely pace, allowing the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the world of Olcay Hanim (Yildiz Kenter), an elderly woman grappling with the specter of mortality and the profound loneliness that accompanies it. Her only solace is her beloved cat, Hanim, a feline companion who becomes a symbol of both companionship and the fear of abandonment.Kenter's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing. She imbues Olcay Hanim with a quiet dignity and resilience, even as she confronts her deepest fears and anxieties. Her interactions with the other characters, including the enigmatic gardener (Esref Kolçak) and the young woman who enters her life (Fatos Sezer), are imbued with a delicate poignancy that speaks to the universal human experience of connection and loss.The film's visual style is equally evocative, with its muted color palette and carefully composed frames creating a sense of melancholic beauty. The cinematography captures the faded grandeur of Olcay Hanim's world, while also hinting at the vibrancy of life that still flickers beneath the surface. The music, a blend of classical and traditional Turkish melodies, adds another layer of emotional depth to the film.\"Hanim\" is a film that lingers in the memory long after the final credits roll. It's a testament to the power of cinema to explore the complexities of the human condition with grace, sensitivity, and profound empathy. It's a film that deserves to be rediscovered and celebrated, a reminder that even in the face of loss and loneliness, there is always the possibility of hope and connection.",

Terry McMillan is an author who wrote many books, most notably Waiting to Exhale which was adapted into a major motion picture. That is why I was shocked it was direct to Lifetime.I missed the first part of the movie but was able to catch up pretty quickly. What a roller coaster it ended up being. All of the feels, all of the emotions, joy, happiness, some gut punches it is all here. I highly recommend giving Forever a watch... just have some tissues on hand.",

Second, it is mainly for children. And third, it is Norwegian. These reasons are typical for not having the best movies, but The Snow Sister stands out with its handful of qualities.While the themes and commentary are simple, the movie excels with its handling of the beautiful and emotional story due to several elements. The pacing is almost perfect, the editing is fantastic, the dialogues feel mature, planned, and appropriate, and the actors do great, especially Celina Meyer Hovland (as Hedvig). I love her energy, and I appreciate that she does not do too much out of her role. The main actor, Mudit Gupta (as Julian), is not as good but does worthy. But there is more that elevates the experience. The score is absolutely amazing, which I am a sucker for, and I could listen to it every day. The visuals are great as well, much because of the good camerawork and nice visual effects. Speaking of the story, it is so much to say about it because it manages to be beautiful, tragic, warm, and dark simultaneously. This makes the experience an emotional ride that can touch everybody's hearts.In conclusion, this is a surprising masterpiece. Despite being a children's movie on Netflix, it excels with perfect pacing, mature dialogues, strong performances, and exceptional score and visuals. It beautifully balances beauty, tragedy, warmth, and darkness, making it an emotional journey for all viewers.",

Welles, whose Mercury Theatre company produced a musical version of \"Around the World in 80 Days,\" was in desperate need of money just before the Boston preview. Mere hours before the show was due to open, the costumes had been impounded and unless Welles could come up with $55,000 to pay outstanding debts, the performance would have to be canceled. Stumbling upon a copy of \"If I Die Before I Wake,\" the novel upon which this film is based, Welles phoned Harry Cohn, instructing him to buy the rights to the novel and offering to write, direct and star in the film so long as Cohn would send $55,000 to Boston within two hours. The money arrived, and the production went on as planned.",

However, what keeps it organic is the actors' performances by Sudheer Babu, Sai Chand and Sayaji Shinde. All three deliver a beautiful performance.Screenplay by Abhilash Kankara, MVS Bharadwaj and Shravan Madala despite taking some cliched scenes and including some forced sequences delivers an engaging story. The movie's editing could have been better in terms of delivering the emotional impact and building the connection with the audience. It did work, but it could've been better.The film rolls like a pleasant journey unfolding in front of your eyes. It is very inviting and feels open. It doesn't take the audience for granted and manages to close all the loose ends with an emotional high that maintains throughout.This is a perfect family for those who love sentiments and emotions. Go watch it.-CinephileIndia2023.",

Due to the Soviet's policy of forced atheism in the early 1900s, Estonia remained secular for many years, leaving it as one of the least religious countries in the world as of the 21st century.",

Although the storyline was somewhat predictable with love interests getting snowed in along their journey (but that's why we watch these romantic holiday movies, right?), the \"non-Diva\" influencer/model lead was unexpected. She was cast well to be a likable character and build the needed personal connections. I found the mother and her home to be relatable and realistic but think some other actors fell short. The manager, brother, and younger sister over-acted. Good script but heir line delivery felt unnatural. Still, it was a sweet movie worth watching.",

Before the bridge keeper appears, a raven is seated outside his hut. The raven was considered to be sacred to Odin. When the bridge keeper is finally shown up close, it can be seen that he is one-eyed, which is Odin's most prominent feature, having sacrificed an eye to attain wisdom. Finally, when Ingeri sits in the high-seat, she suddenly has seemingly clairvoyant hearing. This is a nod to Odin's high-seat Hlidskjalf, from which he could see all things happening in the world.",

Yes, I am one of those people whose heart strings are easy to pull but I won't lie, I was not ready for what this movie held in store.Ah how much I love Adarsh Gaurav. He always manages to be in the best movies. I love his persona and the presence he creates is just brilliant. Siddhant was a surprise as well. I remember being a little disappointed in both him and Ananya after Gehraiyaan. I hated that movie but Siddhant can really portray a charismatic womanizer, the perfect cassanova and this movie uses him to achieve that brilliantly. Ananya, seems to have grown a lot. This performance definitely falls under her top 3, heck I would call it her best performance yet. Pretty darn impressive.About the movie, like I said before, with a name \"inspired\" by the lyrics of a song, I didn't, I couldn't expect much. I decided to watch the movie at 1.25x speed and yes, the first half is kinda slow and could've been paced faster but doesn't matter, as the movie progressed, it revealed a lot layers deep within itself. The portrayal of the ugly things that go behind social media, the toxic influencer culture that permeates our society. It is a revealation. I loved that these topics were covered because I am definitely in for that.I would love it if more such movies are made and hopefully these messages are taken positively by the community and we learn something from these. Really wish for that to happen.",
