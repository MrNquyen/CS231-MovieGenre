Hugo said he was horrified by the unfairness of the woman's situation, and began to imagine that she might have children depending on her, and thus Fantine appeared in his mind.",

The city needed to expand its acreage so that they could expand the harbor so they sold water lots. People would take an abandoned boat, scuttle it, and then claim the lot. To keep it they had to fill in the water by dumping rock, sand, and dirt. As it settled, much of it served to support the ships and many of the hulls were preserved largely intact. Decades later as underground utilities were being installed the ships were discovered. So far they have found some 500 of them. Much of downtown San Francisco was built on top of them,",

She actually won two individual Bronzes, and Gold in the 4 x 100m Relay. She and her team-mates took part in the welcome home parade for the US team. Second, almost exactly a year passed between Ederle's first and second attempts to swim the English Channel, with her returning to New York between the two attempts. The film also omits the fact that, as a \"warm-up\" for her first attempt, Ederle swam 22 miles from Battery Park (NY) to Sandy Hook (NJ) in a time that wasn't beaten for 81 years.",

An early trailer for the film focused less on Princess Rapunzel and more on Flynn Rider, the male lead character. It was originally believed that Disney's marketing campaign was a desperate attempt to search for a particular audience. However, directors Byron Howard and Nathan Greno claimed that the title change was to emphasize that Flynn has as much of a role in the film as Rapunzel.",

French authorities wouldn't let him leave the airport, so he remained in Terminal One, a stateless person with nowhere else to go. He was eventually granted permission to either enter France or return to Iran, but he chose to live in the terminal and tell his story to anyone who would listen. Reportedly, his mental health deteriorated over the years. When given the opportunity to live in France, he refused because the documents did not identify him as \"Sir Alfred\", and he claimed to have forgotten his native Persian. He left the terminal in August 2006 to be hospitalized for an unspecified illness. Afterward, he lived in a hotel on the money received from the film (DreamWorks reportedly paid him $250,000 for the use of his biography). Nasseri moved back to Charles de Gaulle airport in October 2022. He died in terminal 2F on November 12, 2022.",

Ulliel passed away on January 19, 2022 following a skiing accident, and the filming for 'The Beast' was delayed again. In February 2022, Bonello told Variety that he would likely recast Ulliel's role with a non-French actor. On May 16, 2022, it was announced that British actor George MacKay was cast as the male lead and that filming was scheduled to start in August 2022.",

The second movement begins when Eilis leaves for Brooklyn, and the first proper wide shot is featured, while the colors become more playful as a nod to how America in 1952 was on the cusp of pop culture kicking off. The third movement is back in Ireland, brighter, more glamorous, and \"subtly more colorful\" than the first movement.

Another goddamn stand-up comedian here to make fun of us at our sacred rituals.' Well, I'll have you know, I'm not such an outsider. I am quite sought after in the film world. I would like to share with you a real email that I got from my agents about thirty days ago. This is an actual email that they sent me on December 7th, [2023,] so you'll get an idea of who you're dealing with. 'John, in anticipation of our conversation, attached please find the untitled Maggie Gyllenhaal project written and to be directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.' That makes sense. 'Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Osnat Handelsman[-Keren], and Talia Kleinhendler are attached to produce for Warner Brothers. Christian Bale is negotiating to star opposite Jessie Buckley.' I know who one of those people is. 'There is no script available at this time.' Okay, I'm listening. 'Pending, pending your response to the material. Please use the attached sides to put yourself on tape for the role of Young Cop.' Let's, thank you. They really sent this to me. WME [the entertainment agency William Morris Endeavor] sent this to me, let me be clear. I'm not being OFFERED Young Cop. They're giving me the chance to throw my hat in the ring. And yes, I put myself on tape, and, no, I didn't get it, but. . . . Let's stop focusing on failure, all right? Enough failure. Tonight, there are only winners.\"",

Post-production in Amsterdam had to be delayed until June 2019 to allow time for him to recover from his surgery. However, subsequent complications from pain medication caused an intestinal obstruction that ended in a life-threatening colon perforation; fortunately, Verhoeven's wife urged him to go to the hospital in time. Verhoeven and producer Saïd Ben Saïd agreed to delay the release to 2020 in order for Verhoeven to recover, and be fully present during the post-production process. Verhoeven still credits his editor Job ter Burg for finishing much of the film on his own while he himself was recovering and unable to attend. Eventually, the world-wide COVID-19 pandemic caused the movie to be delayed for another year.",

The two were kept isolated from each other and Lyne would tell Basinger rumors about how Rourke intended to make her like or dislike him so that she would carry that attitude into the scene.\nLyne would also offer Rourke performance notes, but Basinger none, in order to unnerve her. In a very unusual and expensive move along these lines, Lyne shot the film sequentially, so that Basinger's actual emotional breakdown over time would be effectively translated to the screen.",

Save the manor, shop, building, landmark, etc...In the opening scene we see not one, but four female leads. There is no mystery that this is the first of several movies in a series. I figured, since there are four leading ladies, there must be four films in this \"unwrapping\" franchise. I see only three listed, but that simply means it's a couple weeks too early to list the air date of the fourth. I noticed that the most notable female of the four is not starring in the three listed, so I assume she'll get the fourth installment (the currently unlisted one). If one is released each week, the fourth one will be in early December. The first week in December is usually an important week for Hallmark releases.This particular story begins very sluggishly, but it starts to grow on you gradually until the conclusion, which was somewhat endearing. But in the end, this film is right in the middle of the pack. If I had to pick a quintessential average Hallmark movie, this one is one of a thousand that blends in to the woodwork. I don't plan on returning to watch it, but it was nice for a one time viewing. It was not a total waste of time, if you are wondering.",

I go away and do a film like Monster's Ball with a very explicit sex scene with Halle Berry. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world and I am talking on the phone to my wife, and she says, 'What have you been doing today?' And I say, 'Oh, I did that sex scene with Halle Berry.' You are then asked if you actually touch her. I say, 'I had to - it's in the scene'. Other people's situations are hard, with areas of doubt.

Though they initially stayed in touch over the telephone, they lost contact eventually. In 1994, Linklater shot Before Sunrise (1995), based on his night with Amy. Like Jesse in \"Before Sunset\", Linklater was secretly hoping that Amy had heard of the movie, and would show up at the premiere, but she did not. When \"Before Sunset\" was released, she did not show up either. It wasn't until 2010, before Linklater started production on the second sequel, Before Midnight (2013), that a friend of Amy, who knew about their story, contacted Linklater to tell him that Amy had died in a motorcycle accident on May 9, 1994, at the age of 24, a few weeks before he started shooting Before Sunrise (1995).",

There's no hanging moments, the awkwardness of the two couple (based on the acting) is so natural, not BAD acting. I felt the feelings that the two characters were feeling. I felt everything,So if you are again, a fan of FILIPINO ROMANCE MOVIE or you are a fan of JOSHLIA, then this movie is for you.",

Mameha's hair was side swept with simple buns or generally loose over one shoulder to give her a simple elegant appearance, as Mameha is supposed to be naturally beautiful.

It's her favorite historical romance novel.The ambience of fairy tale is palpable from the beginning. Not fantasy or anything akin to that, just a simple and whimsical feeling of a somewhat lonely woman who is tired of being a pushover. She is momentarily swept into a better place.As the story unfolds, her imaginary prince is very similar to a new stranger in her life. As we become acquainted with him and his wealthy family, it's clear that the two are going to face some adversity in their fledgling relationship, because she does not belong in his affluent world.I enjoyed the atmosphere created by the music and cinematography. The story is not unique whatsoever, but I feel some credit is well deserved for creating a particular mood. This is a decent movie overall. In contrast, there are many minor, yet bothersome errors, which speaks volumes as to the director's proficiency. Get the little details right, is my only advice.",

No idea where Lifetime got that idea from...!!Jokes aside, the film that is oh-so-loosely based on the Taylor Swift/Travis Kelce romance features plenty of nods to the famous couple along the way and when you set that aside, it's still a very good Christmas romance movie, one of the better Lifetime efforts in recent years. Sure, parts of the movie are contrived and you can see the conflict coming a mile away, not to mention the ending. Not that any other Christmas movie isn't similarly formulaic.Jessica Lord (who is absolutely gorgeous, and has a chance to look radiant in some of her costumes) as Bowyn and Laith Wallschleger as Drew Gonville bring their characters to life. I've never seen either actor before, but they play their parts well. Their scorching chemistry is evident right from their first scene together and it's what makes this film so successful. Very-well cast. Sometimes you wonder what the casting people see in a couple who are terrible on screen. Indeed, a lesser coupling than Lord and Wallschleger would have sent this movie down the crapper. Instead, their presence elevates \"Christmas in the Spotlight\" above the rest of the pack.Not an Oscar-winner, but great entertainment nonetheless. Depending on certain real-life developments, I wonder if we'll get a sequel?",

We'd find out how far that was when we got there. Then for two days we talked through the scenes point by point, in complete detail and without inhibitions, discussed every second of these scenes - completely and candidly. What does the character feel, what gets him/her excited, why? What kind of power relationships are at work? At what point do they change? And so on... What turned out well - and this is what is often the problem in sex scenes - is that the actors were always aware that they were characters, that they were playing the story and sexuality of characters. That gives you protection, lets you take greater risks. Because of this, the shoots were very exciting and sometimes really moving.\"",

Attending a church service hardly does that.Did the creators of the movie think an Army captain fits that bill? Instead of learning an actual truth (the Army doesn't care if you miss your family), Daisy learns a fantasy that if a soldier tells God he wants to go home, God will grant his wish. What about the enlisted guys Captain Daddy left behind? As a former Army Officer's wife, I can recall being pre-empted on Christmas for lonely soldiers my ex-husband had to inspire morale into.This channel needs to get its writers and producers out of Beverly Hills and talk to some regular people. L. M. Alcott's original is so much more relatable than this misguided production.Still, it filled some of a night for us.",

They should have made him the bad guy, which indeed he was. He ended up setting all these people adrift to die, without any real justification. Maybe he'd gone island crazy.

Cunningham, a thirty-year veteran of the police force in nearby Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., was a regular customer at the restaurant, well-liked by the staff there. (His favorite dish was linguine with clams.) One day in March, 1984, Cunningham asked Penzo for help picking his weekly lottery numbers. Penzo suggested three numbers, and Cunningham came up with three more numbers on his own. Cunningham jokingly promised that if he won, he would split the winnings with Penzo as a tip. The next day, to Penzo's surprise, Cunningham and his wife came to the diner with the winning lottery ticket in hand. Cunningham's ticket had won $6 million, which he split with Penzo, giving her $3 million. In real life, however (as stated in a disclaimer at the end of the movie), Cunningham and Penzo were both happily married to other people for many years.",

According to Pedro Almodóvar, the MPAA did not believe an R rating was appropriate, even after cuts, because they were afraid that the film would inspire young men to kidnap young women out of lust. Miramax argued that an X rating implicated pornography and would diminish the film's audience, but they lost the lawsuit and it was released unrated. In September 1990, the MPAA replaced the X rating with the then-newly created NC-17 rating in response to numerous appeals by other filmmakers who had released their films under similar circumstances in the past. Eventually, the film was re-rated NC-17 for its first two (of three) U.S. home video releases (it was re-released unrated the third time; see below), the reason being the explicit scene of a naked Marina taking a bath in her apartment and masturbating in the bathtub under the water with an activated swimming scuba diver wind-up toy.",

The Twenty-Fifth Amendment (which establishes the procedures for responding to a presidential incapacity) had not yet been ratified. Instead of Wilson simply resigning and passing the presidency to his vice-president, Thomas R. Marshall, what happened instead was that the extent of Wilson's illness was kept secret, and his second wife, Edith, started running the executive branch of the U.S. government in his place.",

William Finley was worried about whether the machine would be safe, and the crew assured him it was. The press was fitted with foam pads (which resemble the casting molds in the press) and there were chocks put in the center to stop it from closing completely. However, the machine was powerful enough to crush the chocks that it gradually kept closing. It is commonly believed that Finley pulled his head out of the press just in time to avoid being injured, and that his scream in that scene was genuine, but this is an exaggeration. Finley was quickly pulled out by grips and the record press scene, along with most scenes in the movie with little dialogue, was filmed without sound, and the talking and sound effects were dubbed in later. At a Phantom of the Paradise convention, Finley exaggerated the story and said that his scream was \"for real\", although he may have meant that he was able to conjure up a very real scream in post-production by thinking back to his memories of the incident.",

When Ausiello's source memoir was released in 2017, Ausiello asked Parsons to moderate a Los Angeles Q&A session on it, and when Parsons read the book to prepare for the panel, his husband, Todd Spiewak, found him sobbing in their living room. Spiewak suggested to Parsons that if he had such a strong emotional reaction to the story, he should option it for the movies - which is what they ended up doing together (both Parsons and Spiewak are producers).",

Senhorinha was one of those people, and her scenes were based on a real life encounter Sergio had with a woman from Central Asia in a refugees camp. The actress had also lost her loved ones in the civil war. Even though they were following a script, their dialogue was not rehearsed so the scene was largely improvised and Wagner Moura actually cried during filming.",

They met in summer camp and have been friends ever since and probably will be for the rest of their lives. I really enjoyed this movie. It was charming, heartwarming and very funny. I saw Second Chances first not knowing it was a trilogy, loved it. I am going to watch The Last Dance next. I have no clue who would give this movie a one star or why?

I could have written a better script out of a phone book.The performances are lifeless. The lead actress is absent. She has zero personality and is somewhat snobbish and unlikeable in this.I can see why this movie has no reviews. First of all, it's probably only on Hallmark+, which I subscribe to, but the downside to the app is that it's hit and miss regarding which shows will be available. Basically just flip a coin and you might get lucky.This is the third of the four in the series and it's the worst one so far. I can only hope the fourth is worth my time.I've seen these actors provide wonderful characters in the past, but this story is such a dead end. But, I have to say I know some Hallmark leading men and women that come to play for every performance they are in, no matter how bad the script. Suffice it to say NOBODY came out to play this time.

To aid in this experiment, the film's producers had a video-camera tube attached to the Panavision camera and connected to an Ampex studio videotape machine, allowing the actors and crew to review what they had just filmed. According to a contemporary article in Daily Variety this was one of the first productions to use a video camera in this matter. This eliminated the time and expense of developing the film and showing the \"rushes\" the following day. The cost of this new technology was $1100 per day, but director Blake Edwards said the system saved the production many times that amount by avoiding costly resets and re-shoots on following days.",

The first one begged for a sequel and I'm sad that this is what we got. Rhiannon Fish does her best with the material she has, but the writing is terrible and most of the scenes not involving Fish's Olivia and Bourke's Prince Alexander, whose chemistry is wasted in this movie, were cringey.If there's a third instalment - and it seems like, based on the ending, there will be - I hope it's with different (and better!) writers.",

But the woman who runs the town's historical society wants to keep it, especially since her father was the Postmaster there for most of his career.Christopher Russell and Merritt Petterson do a nice job with the antithetical romance, but that element gets dropped too soon, which is often the case in these cable movies ... this one happens to be GAF, not Hallmark.The writers put them together over a batch of \"found\" Christmas letters to Santa, and the leads come together over making some of those childhood fantasies come true.

I love comedy movies and this one not only has a very original premise (which is apparently hard to do) but it also stars Jon Heder who I hadn't seen in a while. Even though this is marketed as a romantic comedy, I'd say it's way funnier than most of the romcoms coming out nowadays. In terms of humor, it definitely falls in the realm of the R-rated Judd Apatow style romcoms like Trainwreck and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Speaking of, Jamie Lee from Apatow's HBO series Crashing is the lead in this alongside Heder. She's fantastic in this. I hadn't seen her in anything since Crashing and this looks like her first lead role in a movie. I wouldn't be shocked if she starts starring in big blockbuster comedies after this. If you read the logline, you already know that her character is doing something despicable, but she is so funny and charming that you can't help but root for her.",

I feel , that the film is just a vehicle for Jessica Lowndes singing. Her singing is very standard, at best. The male lead actually had a better voice. I guess because he is a man , they don't seem to care about his singing. He seems to sing a lot better and with more power. At times, the female lead is shrill, and even off key\nI'm not sure why the whole movie is just to compliment some girl singer with a voice that's not all that outstanding. It did feel less contrived than most movies of this type. I do think too much hyperbole was used in regards to the singing female lead.",

He also revealed that the character of Lennon's aunt, Mimi Smith, wasn't as mean and vitriolic like she was written in the script. Furthermore, the song \"In Spite of All the Danger\" wasn't written as an ode to Lennon's mother as the script suggests. In the end, they agreed that it's a movie rather than documentary, so Taylor-Johnson made inferences that weren't always there.",

Ferreras and Mestre were a diver couple who used to perform free diving across the world. In 2002 during a free dive in the Dominican Republic, Mestre drowned while surfacing from underwater, as her surfacing device malfunctioned. Following her death, the media strongly suggested Ferreras to be the perpetrator, as he might have interfered the device in order to kill her. He was even arrested for questioning, but was later released. In No Limit, Mestre and Ferreras' story is loosely adapted into a drama between estranged couple Pascal Gautier and Roxane Aubrey. In the film, Pascal is an abusive husband of Roxane who is jealous of her successful career in free diving, something he is not perfect at. The film strongly suggests at the finale that he sabotaged Roxane's breathing device that causes her to drown underwater while surfacing, similar to the death of Audrey Mestre in real life. At the end of the film, an obituary dedicated to Mestre is shown.Following the release of the film, Mestre's widower Ferreras filed a defamation lawsuit against Netflix for blaming him for Mestre's death, as the film claimed to be \"inspired by true events\". In response, director David M. Rosenthal said that the film was a work of fiction and had no similarities with real life whatsoever.",

But she comes around and quickly becomes very likable. She has an exotic beauty that grows on you, a sharp Italian or Greek appearance which took a bit to get used to. As I ponder it a bit, I think now that it's more about her hardness than her look. She is intense at first, then she's suddenly very soft.All that aside, this film is nothing like the first two. This is a good movie. Not a great movie, but above average, although not enough to make it to my 8.0 club. I don't plan on watching this in the next 5 years, but maybe in 7 or 8.",

Yeah, not exactly a horror comedy, especially since the movie was frightfully devoid of anything funny. Sure, the movie was watchable, but I had expected quite something else than what it turned out to be.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, aside from actor Chaleumpol Tikumpornteerawong, but I will say that the acting performances were good. And I do enjoy watching unfamiliar talents on the screen.Visually, then \"Anong\" was an okay movie. It wasn't heavy on special effects, nor overly reliant on the special effects to carry the narrative. But the effects were adequate and helped bring the ghostly characters to life on the screen. But I've seen better effects in other Thai ghost movies.Watchable for what it was, but this was hardly an outstanding Thai movie. Nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.My rating of director Komgrit Triwimol's 2024 supernatural romance lands on a five out of ten stars.",

It was one of the few Disney films never given a second run in the neighborhood theaters, or even re-released, as so many other Disney films were (it first appeared on television - in two one-hour segments telecast a week apart - only eight years after its original release. Eight years was usually the amount of time the Disney studios used to wait to re-release their films theatrically). Disney did not make another musical on this elaborate a scale until Mary Poppins (1964), which became its most successful film during Walt Disney's lifetime.",

I was always a fan of Katrina Bowden in her hilarious 30 Rock supporting role, so it was nice to see her take on a more well rounded character. All the performances are strong, but Mia Armstrong - in addition to being the first time I've seen a character with Down Syndrome in a Christmas movie - was especially adorable. The music was also good. It films sometimes it's hard to believe that the musician character is actual a performer or composer, but Ryan Cooper has a great voice and I was with it. Cute movie. Definitely recommend!",

The one who usually got the worst treatment, drink or no drink, was John Wayne, and he got it good on set. Ford demanded that Wayne also abstain from drink, even though he had no such orders from his physician. Wayne begged producer Martin Rackin to get him away from Ford's omnipresent gaze, if only for a brief moment. Rackin obliged and lied to Ford, telling him that Wayne's teeth were beginning to show up yellow on film and that he needed to take both Wayne and William Holden to New Orleans to have their teeth cleaned. So the drunken trio spent a roaring night in the Crescent City, returning to a furious Ford, who knew through his spies exactly how many bars they had visited.",

The leads seem to lack chemistry, but I think it's because they try so hard to be awkward, maybe they portray it too well. First of all, something about Agostino is endearing and simple. I mean that in a flattering way. She has a way about her, thus the reason why she lands a lead role in the film. There are people out there that feel she has the chops and I am one. Mr. Marshall was fine, nothing noteworthy about his performance, but he played his part well. His character is a confused widower who yearns for a woman, but feels guilty about it. The object of his affections is Agostino's character. Her most notable traits are that a lack of self-confidence, and this is probably unattractive for most viewers. I find it to be endearing and sweet and I can sense it's deliberate. She is a woman who is only self-assured when it comes to giving to the needy and doing kind things for those less fortunate. Otherwise she lacks any self-worth and I see how the audience might be turned off by these traits. To me it seems authentic, and I enjoyed the display. Another outlier for me. This movie has very low ratings, but is a rare surprise of downhearted entertainment (another oxymoron).",

What will you show next? And then the filmmaker would have to outdo himself by showing more. So there was this escalation of violence and sensuality. After my generation, you know what happened? The sexy films became movies with penetration. I don't do that stuff, mine is just simulated. After that, they have to outdo themselves. The filmmakers, the producers and the move-going public wanted to see more. So they have to discover even younger actresses in the street, discover lesser stars, and the actresses became like toilet paper. That's how they (the producers) described them - tissue paper. Use them once and then throw them away. Use them for one to two films - they haven't even recovered money yet to buy themselves a car, and they are already out of the industry. And then they'll get a fresher face, younger. So my contemporaries were a decade younger than me. Because I was in my mid twenties when I was doing the sexy films, and the other films, the lead star is fifteen years old! You know, I was a middle aged woman, and my span of being a sexy star was up to one decade. I was in the industry so long, and there was a huge turnover of actresses. I outlasted them. But I told you, I have a supporting cast who will do all of the worst scenes. And since I'm the blockbuster drawer, I'm the crowd drawer in the film, they capitalize on my name, they listen to my ground rules.\"",

Should I bring it for the production? Maybe we could use it.' We knew immediately how that would fit into our general approach to the photography of the movie. The photography should feel like an omniscient presence in the movie. It should feel very subjective, almost like a third, all-powerful character. So Will came out with the drone and, after almost getting arrested with it in a Moscow airport because they were thinking it was a piece of military equipment he was going to assault Russia with, we got to use it. Any day the crew was off, [co-director/cinematographer] Aaron Moorhead and I would continue to shoot. On Sundays in Italy, we'd continue shooting and that was when we'd do the drone photography with Will. Just grab as many shots as we could, experiment with it, see how it would work. And almost everything we shot with the drone made it into the edit. It's one of the talking points of the movie. It's pretty cool. It's one of those things where one day, because a lot of people have started using them and someday people are going to look at our movie and be like, 'Why did Moorhead and Benson use the fucking toy helicopter thing over and over and over again?'\"[2014]",

            "storyline": "Patrice Chéreau edited the original cut of the film (roughly 160 minutes) to a shorter 138 minutes for international release. This was due to the disappointing box-office performance in France and the criticism (by, among others, Variety critic Todd McCarthy) of the film as being too violent and often incoherent. The French press were scathing of this 'American censorship' (they described the film as having been 'given a face-lift' for American audiences), but the new version was defended by various French critics being both more coherent whilst also maintaining Chereau's artistic vision. The shorter cut was later released in France too, in the hopes of increasing the film's box-office takings. 20 years later, Chereau slightly re-edited his film again and re-mastered it for a new BluRay release with a running time of 161 minutes. This was one of Chereau's last completed acts before his untimely death, so it can be regarded as the definitive version.",

But the movie is not about steamy dreams/fantasies - neither yours nor hers. It is a mechanism - a distraction! A force shield if that comparison works even better for you.So being spoiled and not sure what to do with herself (or the body god has given her), she also is being taken from this world ... well still on planet Earth, but quite a remote location, where she isn't even able to reach any of her friends. It is never clear if they are actual friends or just random people on social media she has gotten to know.I guess you could read a few things into the movie. You could make up stuff that the makers intended or maybe they are your own version of whatever is transpiring. Anyway, this is a quest for self discovery ... accidental, by chance and a bit forced (parents pressuring her to take a trip with them) ... and finally also a bit of nudity.

Precise, direct, economic movement fighting.And kudos for the director for her courage in that MMA direction. She deserves it. The director did not prolong the fights for the sake of attracting \"fight oriented\" audience. But retained the focus on the story.The movie as story telling, is not perfect, but it is believable and flowing. As the phrase goes... \"kurz und scharf\" (= \"brief and sharp\" = ~ \"straight and to the point\").That movie's name, and subsequently its \"description\" here and elsewhere... are misleading and not fit with its contents. Pity. It might draw 'wrong' viewers to it. I wish the description would be changed...Usually I refrain from writing reviews here, but prefer to be reading them. But now... as this movie is still fresh in the arena... :-) and I see only one review ...which missed entirely the whole point of that movie making (and pulls to misleading directions...), I thought to do something about it...\nalso, at times, I look at the movie and its fights from a different perspective, as been dealing with various martial arts (mainly Budo Taijutsu) for over 46 years, (as part of \"way of life\" although dealing with visual arts, design and architecture as my mainstream).So. In short, watch and enjoy.",

I think this movie was made to be used as punishment for prisoners in the gulag, because even though nothing is happening, this movie still manages to be a pain to watch.

When he returned, he found the leper had transformed into an angelic figure that identified himself as St. Lazarus. He said \"For your bravery and kindness, you will enjoy success as a warrior. You will win battles upon battles and never know defeat.\" In a nice nod to the legend, this movie contains a scene wherein the banished Rodrigo encounters a thirsty leper who begs a drink. After unhesitatingly offering his own pouch, the Leper thanks him by name. \"Who are you?\" asks Rodrigo. \"I am called Lazarus\", the leper answers. Then he crosses Rodrigo with his staff. \"May helping hands be extended to you everywhere you go, my Cid.\"",

'I said, 'I've been thinking the same thing.\" And I don't know why. I just felt it. So we read both ways for Harry-and I could tell Harry was panicked when we told him-and it was evident.' 'It was an amazing process,' Macqueen adds. 'They brought that to me, and we decided to do an audition, which is an amazing privilege for a writer-director to have two people like Stanley and Colin sitting in a room reading both roles. I picked five or 10 scenes from the film, and they were kind of brilliant at both roles, as you can imagine. But there was just something about the quintessential Englishness that Colin brought to Sam and a kind gregarious energy that Stanley immediately brought to [the American] Tusker, which made the lighter moments in the film really sing. It just felt right all of a sudden.'\"",

            "storyline": "If anything, it's the equivalent of a ring that has patches of beauty but has too many patches of ugliness. That is not being said with no malice, despite not being taken by the premise part of me did want to like this. Most of 2020's Christmas output (whether Hallmark, Lifetime or other) was a very mixed one, with no film that was exceptional but very few were also terrible. Most ranged between mediocre and decent, but there were some that fell into the extremes of good and bad.'A Ring for Christmas' is one of the 2020 Christmas films that fell into the bad extreme. It has a few good things, though they were more just above moderate good things rather than massive, but they are vastly outweighed by the bad things. And sadly the worst of the bad things are executed absolutely awfully. Other than the production values not being too bad all things considered and a couple of decent performances, 'A Ring for Christmas' was pretty difficult to sit through.The good things shall be mentioned first. The best thing about it is the performance of Dean Geyer, who is very amiable as the one interesting and rootable character in the entire film. Despite being criminally underused, Michael Gross does make much of little and made me smile.Production values show some degree of professionalism and don't look cheap. Parts of the music were pleasant.When it comes to the praise, that is pretty much it. The rest of the acting is awful. On one extreme, we have Kate McGarrigle overacting to an embarrassing degree, this kind of scenery chewing wouldn't pass for guilty pleasure fun but merely annoying. On the other extreme, we have Liliana Tandon completely cold and bland lead performance that has so little emotion or committment. There is no chemistry between the actors, what there was felt made up on the spot, and Gabe is the only character that is worth caring for. Everybody else bored and irritated me and Gross is not in it enough to compensate, despite him being pretty good.In regard to the central relationship, that was on the practically endangered species side. Tandon and Geyer are so disconnected from each other and the relationship itself in the writing goes nowhere for most of the time until rushing it through in the contrived and too pat final quarter. The script throughout is truly awkward and very stilted in a verbose way. Almost like a hastily written first draft not checked through. The story never grabbed me with a very dull first half, which felt slow, over-stretched and uneventful. When it picks up marginally too late, it's very contrived and the whole film has no warmth or charm, no nothing. The direction is routine at best and is often disorganised and hesitant.Bottom line, not good at all. 3/10.",

One reason was because of the constant studio interference that didn't allow Carpenter much creative freedom. Carpenter also called Chevy Chase \"a director's worst nightmare\" and \"nearly impossible to direct\", also saying the same about Daryl Hannah. According to Carpenter, Chase would complain non-stop about the film's tone and hated wearing the special effects, often prematurely removing his makeup and ruining hours of filming. At one point, Carpenter broke a clipboard in half over his knee in a fit of rage when Chase removed his makeup mid-take. Carpenter said that Chase and Hannah were \"immune to any punishment from the studio, and they knew it, so they walked over me and everyone else on set and essentially told us we'd be replaced if we had any problem with them...it was like working with your boss's snooty children who would tattle on you if you didn't bend to their every will.\" Despite this, Carpenter ended up bonding and seeking comfort in Sam Neill over the troubling production and the two became close friends, with Neill agreeing to work with Carpenter again on In the Mouth of Madness (1994).",

There is a lot of physical attraction going on in fact, lots of sex scenes, with T&A nudity between Maks and Maja and then even more with Olga, mostly on the beach, but these are not From here to Eternity lovers in swimsuits.Olga and Maja became estranged when the husband / father died, neither really copying with the grieving process. Maja only reconnects with Olga when she finds out her older boyfriend Maks had started seeing Olga and she plans to break them up with the help of Maks' friend before things go too far.Will vulnerable Olga risk opening her heart to this younger man or have a better relationship with daughter Maja ? Will Maks break both of their hearts when the truth comes out, or by going to Brazil with his friend or will he fall in love with one of them ?The lead actors and their performance's are better than expected in comparison to other Polish films I've recently seen at the cinema. The odd thing here is Maks (Simone Susinna) doesn't speak Polish so a lot of dialogue is actually in English which made it easier to follow for me. The sex scenes are maybe excessive and might put some people off, they are passionate rather than graphic porn though.A slightly unbelievable story I think, or at least unlikely?.",

For someone in the hospital, she was so bubbly and outspoken. She talked SO fast, but she was hilarious and really made the movie.I can't stand elite snobs, especially ones who take credit for someone else's idea(s).

I know this is a low budget movie (at least I hope it is) but several directors have proven that low budget movies can be phenomenal - Everyhting Everywhere, anyone?The production quality is poor, to the point that I came here to double-check on how old the movie is. It really wouldn't be out of place in the 90's. The acting is so perasively poor that I can only assume it's a directing issue - practically every line is over- or underacted. The dialogue lacks cohesiveness, in some cases to the point of nonsense.And to top it all off, it must be the worst casting of Sophia Loren I've ever seen.I could also argue that the story would have been better told had the movie not wasted significant time on Cohen's decision to go to Hydra, and his journey there. The same point could have been made with three or four lines of dialogue once he was there.

We all looked at each other a little strangely, because, I mean, in the film he was playing a sixteen-year-old boy, but in reality he's eighteen, although this excessive shyness helps make him appear younger.\" So Breillat had to rewrite, in part, the love scene between him and Sarah Pratt, creating a choreography that corresponded better to their bodies. Morever, she told her head cameraman that all the scene had to be filmed once, there was to be no repetition, \"because what would happen the first time would be something really upsetting. And it's true, their love scene is magnificent, because all of a sudden you see that he's doing it, he's living it, but it's so fragile and so strong at the same time that if there had been a second take he would have already been used to the scene.\"",

Despite his slightly changed appearance, he convinced his family, wife, and fellow villagers that he was indeed Martin Guerre; he and his wife had two more children and he sued a paternal uncle for the claim to his father's estate. That uncle became suspicious that this returned Martin Guerre was actually an impostor named Arnaud du Tilh, and he contrived a way to have him tried for imposture. This suspicion was ultimately confirmed when the actual Martin Guerre arrived in court during du Tilh's trial. Arnaud du Tilh was convicted and hanged in September 1560.",

Both movies featured Daniel Day-Lewis in prominent and very different roles: in A Room with a View, he played a repressed, snobbish Edwardian upperclassman, while in Laundrette, he played a lower-class gay ex-skinhead in love with an ambitious Pakistani businessman in Thatcher's London. When American critics saw Day-Lewis, who was then virtually unknown in the US, in two such different roles on the same day, many (including Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times and Sheila Benson of the LA Times) raved about the talent it must have taken him to play such vastly different characters. In his review of My Beautiful Laundrette, Roger Ebert wrote, \"A movie like this lives or dies with its performances, and the actors in 'My Beautiful Laundrette' are a fascinating group of unknowns.... The character of Johnny may cause you to blink if you've just seen the wonderful 'A Room with a View.' He is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, the same actor who, in 'Room,' plays the heroine's affected fiancee, Cecil. Seeing these two performances side by side is an affirmation of the miracle of acting: That one man could play these two opposites is astonishing.\"",

The film had only been playing at Puerto Rican cinemas for a few days when the first articles pointing out the similarities between the two films, and pointing out that there was no mention anywhere of it being based on 'Secret Admirer', arose. Once the film was no longer being shown in cinemas across Puerto Rico, Mr. Ortíz first issued a statement saying that there were \"certain similarities between one film and the other, not plagiarism. Everything is a matter of interpretation\". Only a few hours after making that statement, Mr. Ortíz changed it, saying in a radio interview that he \"had done something terribly wrong\", and apologizing to his cast and crew. Mr. Ortíz had ignored and/or refused to comment on the issue until actress Natalia Lugo, who played the lead on Vasos De Papel (2016), released a statement on social media where she both condemned the film and expressed the embarrassment she felt when she saw 'Secret Admirer', and came to understand how she and her fellow actors and crew had been duped.",

Aware of Caprice's previous career as a lingerie model I began watching this TV flick with low expectations...Those expectations were confounded entirely as she turns in a very good performance in the leading role, playing Ivy Allen, a once-successful film director who is in the last chance saloon with the film production company who employ her - her sole remit, after another turkey, is to make another hit film.Believing the actor in her previous hit movie was the magic ingredient in that film's success, Ivy ditches her cheerless festive-free NYC Christmas holiday and flies to out to Serbia to track him down - hoping to persuade him to star in her next film project, as if her future depends on him entirely. Unaware of the Julian calendar used in Serbia she finds out the locals are about to celebrate their Christmas on 7th January (?). With little effort she manages to track him down, with his two sons, but he's dismissive, and wants to forget his previous life as an actor.The story is the right side of sweet, the dialogue is natural and never clunky and the viewer gets a unique chance to see a very different Christmas location and celebration - Serbian stylee.I'm not sure if it's wholely heartwarming or if the two leading characters have real feelings for each other (they seem more like good friends cautiously navigating romance than traditional lovers) BUT I enjoyed watching this film and don't mind watching it one more time.Overall it's a charming story with good performances from the leads and is delivered with - a rarely seen on TV screens - a ladle of Serbian Christmas Charm.",

Love the concept of a niece living with a relative for education purposes, including that the niece is not a boneheadded teenager but a balanced teen that can enjoy the education pursuit and still enjoy the romance of her aunt. Extremely purehearted movie with a few Christmas capers tied in. Despite other reviews, I think the chemstry is fantastic and Sarah Fisher's natural beauty is a huge draw. Robin Dunne is one of my favs as he has done awesome work and this one is no exception. All the supporting cast is FABULOUS! NIce to see Paul and Jan together again this year as a power couple!

There are long pauses trying to look artistic with shots of some pretty scenery, but it's so contrived, you can't enjoy it at all. If you want to see some skin, there's a bit of that, but it's just thrown in again with no real point to the story. My recommendation- save your time and skip this painful drivel.",

The writing, acting and visuals are all done well. Like her memories, the audience gets backfilled on a little more history one step at a time until we see the full picture.If you're looking for action sci-fi or a big psychological thriller, then you'll likely be restless... but if you like a sci-fi backdrop with a Focus on struggling to get your perfect relationship back with a little action to boot, then I think you'll really enjoy it. I'll say it's better than 80% of the movies out there this the rating and my first review. Hope this helps you decide if you should watch.",

It's an account of a family on the verge of losing their maple farm because the bank discovers the deed is not in their name. The true owner is a mysterious person who signed it sometime soon after WWII.In the present day, a doctor and a young woman whose family runs the farm are falling in love. The mystery of the farm is occupying their time more than anticipated and soon becomes an impediment to the romance. In the past, we see her grandmother longing for a man to return from the war. He is not much more than a stranger to her, but she is in love with him and he with her. There are other men involved both in the past and present, and we are left trying to solve the mysteries of unrequited loves and how they all began. Who owns the farm, who will discover the identity of the stranger and the mystery deed owner?First of all, there are way too many commercials, so this film must have a runtime of 80 minutes. That's fine, but with a story so rich with so much potential, more is better. Nevertheless, it's very easy to get lost in both the back story and the present one, both so fascinating, it's difficult to pick which is better.It's a very intriguing mystery that keeps us guessing who, when, and where. Enjoy it for the excitement, the romance, or both, but either way this is two stories unconventionally rolled into one short film.",

Mom and dad are separated due to some unknown circumstances that we are not aware of until much later. She gives us her reasons why she told him to go live with his mother, but those aren't the actual problems. What also happened is he misspent some precious money and she felt somewhat betrayed. He didn't cheat or anything. The whole premise is very weak. If a marriage can break on something as flimsy as this, we are all doomed. But the rest of the film is not too bad. Yes, the parents bicker. Yes, there are slow parts. The children are endearing and the fitness woman is actually likable too, as is the \"elf\". The mother is a regular Latina seen in many films and she does fine. The lead female grows on you after a while, but she is an acquired taste, and my theory is that she is the reason for many negative reviews. The lead male is charismatic, but his personality is absent. For some reason he's not present and it's disconcerting, because beside his apparent lack of focus, he just doesn't show up for the part. I wonder if that's not the final straw for this movie. Cast two different lead actors and you probably have a winner here. What are the odds that both of them fail to entertain? Oh well, it happens.",

But this film turned out to be an absolute riot, way beyond what I thought it would be. I lost count of how many times I busted out laughing, and it wasn't just me - the whole theater was in stitches. The story threw some curveballs that I never saw coming, and the creativity in those unexpected moments? Genius.Let's talk about the main cast, Kang Ha-neul and Jung So-min - they killed it. The chemistry between them? Off the charts. And the other folks in the cast weren't slouching either - everyone held their own. Big shoutout to the director and the writers, too - they nailed it.If you're in the mood for a good laugh and a dash of romance, seriously, check this one out. And get this - I'm usually all about horror, but even with that background, I can vouch for this film. It's like a universal crowd-pleaser, breaking through genres and giving you the perfect mix of humor and romance. Don't miss it!",

She was cast after having been recommended to director Paul Mazursky by \"Girlfriends\" (1978) director Claudia Weill. Russianoff said that she improvised most of her dialogue, which was based on the type of therapy she gave her patients. After the movie was launched, Russianoff became a mini-celebrity. She said the role gave her \"instant celebrity-hood,\" being recognized on the streets of New York, where she signed autographs, and got a number of new clients. She wrote several self-help books in the 1980s, including \"Why Do I Think I Am Nothing Without a Man?\" (1988), a book first published about a decade after this film, but with a title and subject matter that were reflective of this picture.",

Bhansali initially wanted to cast Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, his lead pair from Straight from the Heart (1999), as the lead actors, with Bhoomika Chawla playing Kashibai, but his plans fell through when the real-life couple had a messy, highly-publicized breakup. Bhansali kept Khan on and approached Kareena Kapoor to play Mastani and Rani Mukerji to play Kashibai but shelved his plans and moved on to other projects after Khan and Kapoor both signed on to star in Kyon Ki... (2005), as he had wanted to be the first director to unite the pair, as he stated on the talk show Sanjay Leela Bhansali & Aishwarya (2004). Over the following decade, Bhansali kept expecting the project to be his next film, with several major actors being approached or rumored to be linked to the project, including Shahrukh Khan, Ajay Devgn, Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif, while some in the industry believed it would never be made, calling it jinxed. The project was finally properly revived in 2014 when Bhansali finally decided on his lead actress from Mary Kom (2014), Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and his lead pair from Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram Leela (2013), Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone.",

Yet, it's also a stunningly tender portrayal of love, loss, and the complexities of human emotion. The 1920s setting is simply breathtaking; it evokes the same sense of longing and beauty as Call Me By Your Name. I applaud the film for balancing the harrowing depictions of queer history with heartwarming portrayals of love. A truly remarkable film. Kudos!",

In Balat you can find very modern coffees, chef's restaurants, beautiful scenery of Halic. It is not a place where you can buy spices, it is not a spice bazaar. It is very disgusting to show places and people in a way where the truth is not reflected.The movie itself is also horrible. Characters are very superficial. A lonely rich woman, a rich and busy man, a wild and poor man. These are the prototypes and even a normal person can write such a text with these superficial characters. I wanted to rate it with a zero but it is not possible. Horrible.",

Andrea Bang (from Kim's Convenience fame) and Joe Scarpallino give excellent performances and it's important, as this movie focuses entirely on their interactions/relationship. The acting was the standout piece and their on-screen chemistry and the solid, believable delivery are rarely seen in movies these days.Unfortunately, for these 2 actors, the plot does them no favors. In fact, there is no plot, other than Grace sabotaging herself and her romantic life for about an hour and a half. It's a shame, because the acting is enough to keep you engaged in the movie... until you ask why you are even watching in the first place. There was nothing interesting or exciting in the story and it's easy to lose interest.If you are looking for a character-driven drama or are the sort of person who needs good characters in a movie, this film is for you. If you need anything more, it's hard to find it in \"Stay the Night\" and you may find yourself bored by the half-hour mark.",

Acting: Painful to WatchThe lead actor shows two emotions: sleepy and lost.The supporting actors look like they didn't want to be there either.Dialogues are so unnatural, even AI could do better.3. Cinematography: Feels Like a Home VideoRandom camera angles that make no sense.Shaky shots gave me a headache.4. Music: Please Make It StopSongs that make your neighbor's wedding music sound good.Lyrics so meaningless, you'd prefer silence.Background score? More like background noise.5. Length: Never-Ending TortureEvery scene feels 10 minutes longer than it needs to be.Even the clock in the theater gave up ticking.6. Special Effects: Straight from the 90sExplosions look like someone threw red powder in the air.7. Audience Reaction: Regret EverywhereThose who watched full either fell asleep or were scrolling TikTok.8. Final Verdict:Watching Raswa Dirgha is like sitting in traffic for 3 hours-frustrating, boring, and a complete waste of time.If you love yourself, don't watch this movie. Even staring at the ceiling is a better use of your day.Recommendation: Avoid. Even if someone offers free tickets, run in the opposite direction!",

On the morning of the first day, Seitz found Sturges inspecting the set with a viewfinder, looking for where he could cut the scene and change camera set-ups. Seitz dared him to do it all in one take. Never one to refuse a dare, Sturges took him up on it, although the nervous Seitz had never attempted to complete a two-day work schedule in one day. With the endorsement of McCrea and the rest of the actors, Sturges pressed on, determined to set a record. The first take was fine, but the camera wobbled a little in the tracking shot following the men from screening room to office, so they tried again. They did two or three takes at the most and that was it - two full days work by 11 a.m. on the first day, a feat that had the entire studio buzzing.",

In fact, on the movie's commentary track, Verhoeven has stated that the reason he was not fazed by the negative criticism of Showgirls (1995) was because he'd already been through it with Spetters (1980). He also pointed out that he also moved to America because it grew difficult to get funding. \"All Dutch movies were fifty to sixty percent subsidized by the government. I was denied government funding because my movies were considered to be decadent, perverted, and antigovernment. That's when I had to leave. The problem was the leftists -- they are so fucking dogmatic. At that time in Holland, they were often more fascistic than the right.\"",

Additionally, Godard went on to say that because the film was not truth and because the film was a hit, that they should make a film together about the filmmaking process; Truffaut would produce, Godard would direct, and they would co-write the script. Godard's return address was of Jacques Daniel-Norman, a virtually unknown filmmaker whose films were loved by Truffaut and Godard when they were film critics, hinting at a return to a simpler time. Ignoring this hint, Truffaut was insulted by the letter and responded by telling Godard that he is demeaning and pretentious and that he pretends to be poor, when in reality he was the wealthiest of their circle of friends. The response also included a line in which Truffaut flat out calls Godard a \"shit\". It is believed that this quarrel is what ended their lifelong friendship. Godard later regretted writing this letter, especially after Truffaut's early death in 1984 and went as far as to write a moving tribute to his former friend.",

While O'Neal barely had time to duck, young Coppola was struck, throwing his body to the metal deck, sustaining head injuries whereby he died instantly. O'Neal was later charged with manslaughter over the tragedy. He was ultimately fined $200 and sentenced to eighteen months probation in 1987, eventually receiving an eighteen-day jail sentence for not performing 400 hours of community service as ordered. A law was later passed requiring short towlines between boats. At the time of his death, Coppola's fiancée, Jacqueline de La Fontaine, was two months pregnant with their only daughter, Gia Coppola, who was born on January 1, 1987.",

            "storyline": "I don't normally \"pile on\" when there are already fairly negative reviews, but even going in with an open mind (and low expectations) wasn't enough to prepare me for HOW frustrating this film was. Many have either knocked it for \"not enough dance\" or not \"good enough\" dance, which are valid but actually sit well down the list for me as to what is wrong.To me, the ENTIRE conceit that these two women had \"male\" inner/alter egos just did not work on ANY level. Could they, maybe, in some other form? Yes, I can imagine it though I still don't see the point. Why have a story about two women and hardly ever show them as women? There were so few scenes with them both who they actually were (women) that it made it impossible for any sort of character development to happen, and the chemistry between the various \"alter\" couplings was practically nil. The sex scenes were clumsy for the most part, which I guess comes down to the use of non-actors (all dancers) though again, for me it was just the jarring fact that every one of them were depicted as opposite sex versions of themselves. If it were 50/50 it might have worked a little, but this was 100% of them.Even simple scenes where the two women might be sleeping next to the other, or having breakfast, had one of them as a man. Not only did neither of the women present as \"masculine\" in any way, but the men \"playing\" the women did not at all feel the women they supposed were playing. It was as if the director was telling a story (of two women in a relationship) that they didn't actually want to tell at all. Why this would be, I never could figure out. The other feeling you start to get by the end is that maybe they cast two women really uncomfortable with any physical contact with one another. Maybe that wasn't the case in reality, but that's how it feels.The Dance Aspect\nI'll admit, I am not a huge \"dance\" fan and in many respects I'm not even sure that the art-form is a good match for film in general. Nor do I think multimedia is a great thing to bring into dance performances. That said, the times I've enjoyed dance productions the most have all been live and in person. That's kind of the whole point it seems to me; being in the space that they are and feeling the energy that comes from the performance. This applies to classical ballet as much as modern dance too.Sure, there have been \"some\" great films that have heavily featured dance, albeit usually in the form of musicals, but the format here felt forced most of the time, other than the first scene where the two main characters were conversing via email. That actually kind of worked, chiefly because we were seeing a kind of abstracted emotional representation of what was happening behind their words. But as others have said, that was at the very beginning, and all but a few others seemed either thrown together or just out of place.Still, in the end, it was less the dance than the storytelling that didn't work, and especially the \"alternate\" characterizations.",

Yada yada\". And actually on another day I might not have stuck with this one, because it really was so depressing and harsh, but I had spent the day cleaning the kitchen, so I was too tired to even reach for the remote.It seemed quite cheaply made overall, so I was surprised that the singers could actually do the songs justice. The producers must have read some of my other reviews?Unlike 'My Christmas Family Tree' (2021), which was also about a reunion with an absent father, this film put too much focus on the Dad (Bailey Chase) and the romantic element seemed lost and a bit surprising as it developed so suddenly. Lanie MacAuley as Skye really fell hard for Ryan (Bo Yokely) and very quickly and he did the same in return.I wasn't totally sold on Ryan actually, because although I liked his muscles, there was so little time to get to know him and consequently it wasn't easy to see their romance blossom or feel their connection. And it seemed a bit false too.Bailey Chase did at least look better in this one than he did in the last one I tried to watch with him in - 'Shoelaces For Christmas' (2018). Now that was one I did turn off and fast.This film also had more endings than 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King' (2003). Just when I thought it was over it would keep going again and not really with any need.Honestly though, it wasn't so bad that I wanted to pluck my eyes out with flaming and rusted spoons, but Bailey looking quite as perfect as he did won't be enough to make me watch it again.5.50/10.",

Is it safe that young people are not exposed, defamed and stereotyped? That the negative image of pornographic youth is avoided?\" says sex educator and counselor Petra Winkler. On the set, they were always approachable for the young actresses, with whom they had built up a good level of trust in the run-up to the shoot. \"We were not governesses,\" says Winkler. \"The girls weren't forced to play in the film, they wanted to be part of it. Still, nudity, sex and intimacy in front of the camera were new and sometimes borderline. \"In one scene, one actress was so insecure that she stopped shooting,\" the pro familia expert describes a situation. \"It helped her that I was there as an outsider to bring calm into the scene and could talk to her.\"",

In 2002, it was finally moved to Genoa, Italy, where it is now a floating museum in the city's port, near the \"Molo Veccio\" (\"Old Pier\").",

It was filmed near an active nuclear test site in Utah, where 11 tests had reportedly been carried out in the year before the production landed there. The set was contaminated by nuclear fallout, but the Atomic Energy Commission assured Howard Hughes and the local population that the area was completely safe. Photographs exist of John Wayne holding a Geiger counter that reportedly made so much noise that he thought it was broken. After location shooting, Hughes had tons of contaminated soil transported back to Hollywood in order to match interior shooting done there. Over the next 30 years, 91 of the 220 cast and crew members developed cancer. Forty-six died, including John Wayne, Susan Hayward, Pedro Armendáriz (who shot himself soon after learning he had terminal cancer), Agnes Moorehead, John Hoyt, and director Dick Powell. Lee Van Cleef had throat cancer, but died of a heart attack. The count did not include several hundred local Native Americans who played extras, or relatives of the cast and crew who visited the set, including John Wayne's son Michael Wayne. A \"People\" article quoted the reaction of a scientist from the Pentagon's Defense Nuclear Agency to the news, \"Please, God, don't let us have killed John Wayne\". As of June 2011, the article is available in its archive online. It has however been suggested that many of the cast and crew died of cancer as a result of smoking. John Wayne had smoked 3-5 packs of cigarettes a day since the early 1930s, and many of the other actors and crew members were also heavy smokers.",

This news soon spread completely across the country, and with threats of lawsuits in the air, Olivier quickly made a statement to the press claiming that in the end, the movie had been made well, and that he totally supported it. Olivier also wrote a handwritten ten-page letter to director Richard Fleischer, not only apologizing for the restaurant incident, but also indirectly giving an explanation as to why he was making so many movies strictly for the money.",

            "storyline": "Stories based on the notion that \"truth is stranger than fiction\" often provide a great foundation for comedy, and writer-director Natja Brunckhorst's second feature is evidence of that. This fact-based tale set in 1990 during the transitionary days of German reunification follows the newly uncertain lives of a group of working class residents in the city of Halberstadt as they seek to cope with the emerging social, economic and political paradigm that has been thrust upon them. As their East German homeland is absorbed into its Western counterpart, the socialist nation begins evolving into a new capitalist enclave. But this process is fraught with serious fiscal consequences with hard-hitting impact on East Germany's citizens, many of whom now find themselves without work and a source of income, prospects that are likely to persist for at least a year, if not longer. And, unless they swap their soon-to-be-worthless East German currency for Deutsch Marks by a fast-approaching deadline, they'll be without savings and working capital, too. So, in the face of these pressing circumstances, it's truly ironic that a quartet of financially strapped locals should stumble into a huge stash of East German money that's been casually disposed of in an underground (and surprisingly easily accessible) bunker, left to decay - and available for the taking. They impulsively grab as much as they can carry, but they're nevertheless left with the question of what to do with it in the face of the impending exchange deadline. The answer lies in a creative money laundering scheme cleverly cooked up with a host of similarly situated community residents who seek to not only trade in the newly acquired cash without drawing undue attention, but also to expand upon the legitimately scrubbed reserves to build an even larger mutually held nest-egg. Doing so has its share of challenges, though, both economically and personally, yielding more than its share of surprises, conflicts and hearty belly laughs. While the film is a little slow to get started and has a few moments that either could have been eliminated or executed more deftly, \"Two to One\" otherwise delivers on all fronts. The picture's fine ensemble cast, crisp writing, catchy soundtrack and spot-on period piece production values mesh well, spinning an inspiring, touching and humorous underdog yarn about hard-pressed everyday folks rising up to address extraordinary circumstances. It's also a feel good, family-oriented tale told in an unlikely setting under unlikely conditions that are probably little known to those outside of Germany, but one that effectively proves once again that the truth really is often stranger than fiction.",

He thinks offering funding to the little clinic would be a great move to make his company appear in a positive light.The meet and greet between the two MCs was a disaster, ending in Dylan storming out of the clinic threatening to cancel funding.In the meantime, his uncle Blake, Dylan's confidant and right-hand man in the company falls and hits his head developing a concussion.After treatment at the very clinic he stormed out of, Dylan insists that Ivy drop her patients and stay in the villa with them to care for his uncle around-the-clock.Yes there was the educated, caring beauty (Ivy) who would only take so much from the billionaire before a well-deserved clap back.And yes, there was the cold, heartless rich guy (Dylan) who only thought of himself and treating everyone else as though they were put on the earth as an afterthought.And of course, there was the back-and-forth dialog between the MCs gradually leading to the realization that opposites really do attract even ones who appear totally polar.What happens afterwards is a journey neither one saw coming.\"Bali\" captured the spectacular landscapes and touched on challenges facing the community. The film's pace may be a bit slow at some points, but that should be no surprise in tropical spaces.This 2024 Beauty and the Billionaire: Bali has no character relations to the original Beauty and the Billionaire (also written by Brittany Wiscombe) released in 2022 other than the film's preface.As of this writing, IMDB has no rating for this movie.I would rate this movie a solid 6.0 for two reasons, 1) The beautiful scenery and 2) without giving too much away, the surprise motive of one of the characters.Check out Beauty and The Billionaire: Bali. That surprise motive and ending alone makes \"Bali\" worth the watch.",

The 'cut' was yelled only after Weller put his mouth on the actress' crotch and kissed it for 15 seconds. At that time Weller was simultaneously filming Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite (1995) and thus had the opportunity to tell the New York director about the erotic-sexual performance that Antonioni had asked of him. \"Woody looked at me rapt and wouldn't stop asking me for details. I don't know how many times he got the story repeated,\" Weller said.",

The acting is less than middle of the road, chemistry is non-existent, and costuming is...well, laughable. Seriously, who does the wigs??? They are utterly horrible, I've seen better at Halloween costume shops.This installment runs into the exact same problems Wicked had. No chemistry between characters and lackluster acting. Seriously, I've seen much better in Lifetime movies. There's no spark between the actors at all, just regurgitated lines from the book...only NOW, we have a Prince of the Fey to contend with too...and he's bad, and I don't mean that in a good way either. The acting is REALLY bad, fortunately...the atrocious wig they stick on him that is stiff and lifeless distracts from his less than impressive acting.The Prince, who is supposed to be gorgeous is made comical by the wig the costumers put on him (really, you couldn't spring for hair extensions or something like that?) This wig is so stiff and lifeless and so obviously a wig that it reminded me of some cheap wig one might buy for Halloween. One would expect hair on him to be \"Fabioesque\", shiny and free-flowing, not something that would remind them of steel wool. Same with Ivy's now obvious wig (you can literally see the wig line). In Wicked it appeared the actress may have had her own hair or extensions...so why this comically red wig now?The special effects with the fey's eyes is pretty decent, but this stupid blue streaky thing they do on their skin is just weird. Their skin is supposed to be silvery, this is not silvery...or shimmery...it looks more like water reflections from a pool, and it's an odd blueish tone that one might see in a morgue.Also, the actor playing Tink could dial it down a notch or twelve. His cutesy comments and delivery gets old. Yes, I know someone must have listened to the audiobook when studying how to play him...but what translates decently in written word where one can change him up a bit in our reader's imagination, doesn't translate well into a real life character. He's just \"Ivy Divy\" irritating.Loved the books, sort of enjoyed the audiobooks (minus how Tink is done), and will watch the third just to see if anything improves... but won't hold my breath waiting for it to. It's more likely I'll watch the third (if they make it) to heckle it and throw popcorn at my tv.Passionflix, you need to step it up...these just aren't good. If I were Jennifer Armentrout, I'd be pissed!",

SIX ... The one f*****g guy I hate, that's the guy they hire. HIM!\" Mohr alleges she returned to the soundstage after using the restroom and immediately continued haranguing him: \"SIX!\" This apparently \"went on the entire day\" as Aniston kept bad-mouthing him to costar Illeana Douglas. To sum up, Mohr swears \"Jennifer Aniston was so f*****g mean to me.\"",

Estranged sisters Lucia and Ofelia differ greatly in their attitudes toward sex, the degree of satisfaction sex provides each of them, and their ability and desire to please a partner. Occasional flashbacks show the havoc already wrought as the women became who they now are.Unexpectedly brought together at Lucia's wedding, the sisters and the men in their lives find self-control overwhelmed by desire. Fidelity gradually goes out the window. When this is discovered, the crap hits the fan.Desire is well acted for a melodrama, and not unbelievable, I think, even though the lifestyle in a wealthy estate is so unfamiliar. The direction left a couple of minor points unclear; that might be the result of my dependence on subtitles. And it's explicitly sexual, which apparently surprised or offended a number of reviewers. If this film -- whose plot is all about sexual desire -- had not shown strongly simulated sex, I would have felt that it failed to suspend disbelief. Desire does not, however, come even close to the \"primarily intended to arouse\" standard of pornography: it's just explicit enough that you know the characters' passions. A couple of kids riding horsie on pillows, made relevant only by the adult narrator, is hardly worthy of complaint. (Unsurprisingly, this scene is removed from the version streaming on Amazon Prime video in 2024.)Watch Desire when your brain is too tired for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but not yet jaded enough for Dirty Blondes from Beyond. It's not great, but it isn't horrible, either.",

It sort of just became an \"ordinary\" sex scene,\" said Børsum, who strongly disagreed with this, but then she didn't feel brave enough to talk out about it, even though she had become an experienced actress of 40 years. \"There were only men on the set, and they were so happy... But I thought that was not good. The mother rips the sweater off her son - it's not something a mother would do in such a situation. I would have made it more clear that this was a relationship between a mother and a son, shown that there was a combination of sex, but also maternal warmth, which seemed redeeming for the main character ...

According to the \"LA Times,\" Raul Julia's agent Jeff Hunter said: \"Our usual above-the-title credit wasn't available. So, we decided not to take any credit at all.\" Director Sydney Pollack said told the same paper: \"The only billing left for Julia was to be stacked with the rest of the names . . . his agent felt that would be a step backward\" and there is a dilemma when there is \"an actor on the ascendancy, like [Raul] Julia, and you ask the actor to do a role that's somewhat smaller [than their emerging star status].\" Julia had found rising-star status since his performance in the Academy Award winning film Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985).",

Instead, \"Attachment\" builds tension through its clever storytelling and masterful cinematography. The result is a movie that is both touching and suspenseful.The relationship between the two women is at the heart of the movie, and the performances by the actresses are top-notch. As the story unfolds, we are drawn into their world and become invested in their journey.One of the most impressive aspects of \"Attachment\" is its use of Kabbalah. The film deftly weaves this mystical belief system into the story, adding a layer of depth that elevates it beyond typical horror fare.Overall, \"Attachment\" is a well-crafted and thoughtful film that is definitely worth watching. It may not be a traditional horror movie, but it is certainly a memorable one. Highly recommended.",

These were two dilapidated buildings in the city center.This tragedy opens the movie; Robert Guédiguian has become the committed director of our times. Like his English peer ,Kenneth Loach,Robert Guédiguian depicts the other side of the mirror ; on the feel-good French scene ,his works are,more than ever ,pivotal ; because they are not exactly what they call 'feel-good\" even though there are moments in his work which give the viewer more joy than the trendy hip flicks.his masterworks \" La Ville Est Tranquille\" \" Les Neiges Du kilimandjaro\" or the neglected \"Une Histoire De Fous \" are endearing tales that go straight to the heart :generous, brash, full of compassion .Rosa (the wonderful Arianne Ascaride , Guédiguian's partner in life ,and the principal in most of his films has these lines which are the key to the movie :\"whe should have two lives :one to take care of ourselves ,and one to take care of our fellow men \".Like many of the director's movies , \"et la fête continue! \" is a chronicle of a family in Marseille. A \"la ville est tranquille\" in miniature , the screenplay is made of subplots (I have always thought that Julien Duvivier was Guédiguian 's closest relative ,particularly \"la belle équipe\" \"sous le ciel de Paris \" and \"la fête à Henriette\" ( of which \"à l'attaque \" is a political remake of sorts )Rosa ,now sixty , takes stock of her life : a devoted nurse -the scene when she comforted her black colleague, desperate because she didn't hold her patient's hand when he died ,is admirable -,she is also an activist,she has so many tasks on the go at once it becomes impossible to see them through ; despondency is near ,and breaks out during the meeting for the list candidates .Her son has found the woman of her life and he intends to have plenty of children ;besides the father of the future bride is also an activist who falls for Rosa ; it may seem melodramatic on the paper , but Guédiguian 's treatment avoid pathos and dramatization ; The young man's love, after escaping a would be shame, shows him that life can goes on, even if not according to his plans . Her daddy (the wonderful Darroussin, Guédiguian 's favorite actor,he often played opposite Ascaride), will be the light that still shines in Rosa's darkest night .Together they will fight against the \"marchands de sommeil\" (sleep dealers) who rent flats unfit for habitation ,in the scene ,around the bust of Homer, where the voices multiply until they become one.The heroine eventually relaxes to the point of acknowledging that the personal is personal ,as well as political;that in turn makes her more endearing and more effective ;the Aznavour classic.\"emmenez moi\" -unlike most of his colleagues , Guédiguian uses the FRENCH songbook - is a transparent metaphor : outside the hard realities of life, happiness is not out of reach.",

After that he was transferred in 1942 to the camp of Drancy and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau where he would die.\nAlthough all of these traits are shared by the character of André Korben, it is to be noted that the passion for supernatural and spirits belong only to the fictional character, as it is not documented that Bernard Natan shared those interests at all.",

Regarding the water sequences, the film's director Siddharth Anand revealed, \"We can control the action we shoot on land, but while shooting at sea, you're at the mercy of the tide. Three days before the shoot, Hrithik started practicing the stunts for five-six hours daily. It took us eight days to shoot the sequences in water. For another water action sequence, Hrithik trained for four days, before the shooting. He learned to jet-ski with a speed boat pulling him along first. Then, an antiquated plane was brought in with an experienced pilot at the controls, so that it could be slowed down and speeded up at will.\"",

The American distributor sued - case title: \"Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas (1968) - and, on 22 April 1968, won. In its ruling, the Supreme Court stated that censorship aimed at minors was okay, but censorship could not be applied to adults.\nOn the same day, the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in a second case, titled \"Ginsberg v. New York (1968),\" which established that 17 years of age constituted adulthood in cases of censorship. The case involved a New York City luncheonette owner named Sam Ginsberg who was caught selling a \"Playboy\" magazine to a 16 year old in a NYPD sting operation. The Supreme Court ruled that if the boy had been 17 years old, then Ginsberg would have done no wrong in selling him the magazine.\nBy combining these two rulings, the Supreme Court established the precedent that adult-oriented movies were acceptable as long as \"no one under 17 is admitted without parent or adult guardian.\"",

Instead of taking off, Earhart ran to Nichols's plane to drag her to safety. After Earhart was sure that Nichols was not seriously hurt, she took off for Cleveland and finished third. Women in the Wind (1939) is based on the same air race and features a plot loosely inspired by the incident.",

The rest of them were never built, and constructions like the Arch and the Dome were so massive, that architects were unsure of their viability, until recent computer-based simulation have stated that Speer's calculations were correct, and had Hitler won the war, Berlin would have pretty much looked as the movie shows. Interestingly, the movie also portrays Berlin as bleak and gray. In the book, March describes the city looking like this from the never ending construction projects.",

Bianchi makeup in many scenes, she really looked awful :/. It was completely unnecessary as she is natural beatiful. The major issue with this movie, like with many ROE TV movies is the fake location. Supposedly movie takes places in San Francisco except it was clearly shot in Kelowna, CA like so many their other TV movies because if you watch ROE TV movie you recognize the same or similar locations again and again. Consequently in Act I they excessively used SF stock footage to fool viewers. In Act II and almost always untill the end (except few short scenes) movie takes place at a beautiful manor on Okanagan Lake in Kelowna, so they switched to showing Kelowna stock footage in between scenes. Just sad...This is the first TV movie in which Francesca Bianchi and Matt Hamilton are leads and not supporting cast, and right of the bat, they were preety good and convincing. M. Hamilton is a veteran Hallmark TV supporting actor who switched to ROE, he almost always played somehow goofy person, but this time he was mostly serious which is a big difference and he didn't fail.Directing was mostly all right, but writing... How many times we are going to see bridezilla trope? The good thing is that movie is centered around Halle and Jamie, and the rest of cast is mostly limited. I admit that I several times skipped bridezilla parts and whole guessing quiz because I watched it so many times, don't have time to waste. On another hand, dialogue between Halle and Jamie was written really good.Overall, average. With properly written supporting cast and no excessive usage of stock footage, I would rate it easily 7*. And obligatory don't watch trailer as like every other ROE TV movie trailer, it shows everything.",

However, Aretha Franklin (45) also hit number one, albeit on a duet with George Michael, meaning technically two African American singers had achieved the feat. By the time the film was released Mariah Carey (49) had also added to this number. In addition, at the time of filming Sia was the most recent artist to achieve a number one aged over 40. She has worked extensively with both Greg Kurstin, who wrote and produced songs for the soundtrack of this movie, and Diplo, who has a small role in the film as producer R Dubs.",

Things had already gotten off on the wrong foot when Disney Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg when first meeting Baldwin reportedly joked \"We could get a gate guard to do the same job as you.\" Baldwin naturally, didn't take kindly to the joke.As for Basinger, she was accused of habitual lateness (she kept production waiting on the set due to her elaborate morning routine, which included washing her hair with only Evian water and shampoo), flashing the crew, talking filthy on open walkie-talkies, refusing to shoot in sunlight, and demanding that no one look at her. Stories also included Basinger's feud with Simon over her dialogue (Basinger at one point told Neil Simon, \"This isn't funny. Whoever wrote this doesn't understand comedy.\" Simon denied the incident. But he only visited the set one more time during filming) and a prima-donna attitude that ultimately resulted in the firing of the original director of photography because she didn't like how she looked in the test shots that he had taken. One person from the set claimed that at one point, Basinger pushed the director, Jerry Rees aside and tried to direct a musical number herself. Basinger also wouldn't settle for having her makeup touched up between close-up shots. Instead, she had to have her makeup completely removed and re-applied between takes, something that made filming take about 20x longer than it should have. In other words, retakes would take hours instead of minutes. Not only that, but Basinger wanted to shut down production so she could fly to Brazil to consult a psychic.It was also on the set that Basinger and Baldwin began a hot, steamy on-set romance. Allegedly, the crew miked the trailers to record them having sex and they then played them back so that Basinger and Baldwin could hear. One crew-member commented, \"Honest to God, if I were destitute and living on the street with no food and somebody offered me a million dollars to work with Alec and Kim, I'd pass. Their actions were vile, deplorable, despicable.\"",

There is nothing more combative than the union of a man and a woman.I hope there will be a killing ending, like the movie \"Natural Born Killers\", a violent response to the distorted society, but the ending is still a little sad.

How to set up the pieces on a chess board: First set up the board so that the bottom-right square is white . . . Place a rook on each of your two corners . . . Place the knights next to the rooks . . . Place the bishops to the inside of the knights . . . Place the queen on the remaining, matching-color square . . .",

And since Cage is an actor who loves improvisation, to show the domination of the male over the woman he put in such brutality and such participatory violence, that I was terrified, I felt really violated.

What's less well reported is the fact that the ship was also carrying a considerable amount of hard cash. According to official files recently released by the Home Office, there were nearly 290,000 ten-shilling notes on board as well (this would be the equivalent of several million pounds at today's prices), not all of which were recovered. The money was on its way to the West Indies, and the banknotes were of a specifically Jamaican design, making them, of course, immediately identifiable in the Outer Hebrides. Despite this, 20 years after the 1949 film was shown, occasional visitors to the gift shop on Eriskay would find a Jamaican ten-shilling note in their change.",

Sometimes it's too tragedy ridden melodrama, sometimes it's too pink tinted image of what the director wished but never really had in reality.'I love you more' is much calmer, gentler drama. Especially the psychology of the teenage character in his first love, with all his idealism, anxiety, moodiness and blind drive, is depicted fairly realistically. Now as a grown-up, I find him incredibly annoying, but I can't deny I definitely shared a lot of the characters when I was about his age.It's not a perfect product. Ben's life and surrounding lacks the nitty gritty of real life, sceneries are all a bit too majestic every time, parents (especially mom) shows the patience of a saint... Overall everything is shimmering in a sort of golden light of late summer evening. I think it's the director looking back his childhood and his motherland with nostalgia... But at times I wished to see just a bit more rawness.Nevertheless I still think 'I love you more' is a positive addition to the extensive list of gay coming of age films, if nothing else than for the relatable depiction of the teenage psychology.",

It was a decent film, everyone involved did a great job.The visuals were pretty cool, with some imaginative landscapes and interesting stuff in the dream hall in particular. They added a nice touch to the overall experience.The characters were well portrayed, and the cast did a great job bringing them to life. While I didn't feel a deep connection to them, they were still enjoyable to watch, and I really liked the group dynamics.The music was nice and complemented the film well, but it didn't leave a lasting impression on me.Overall, 'Silver and the Book of Dreams' is worth a watch if you're a fan of fantasy films. It may not be the most mind-blowing one out there, but everyone involved put in a great effort, and it's a really solid film.",

(Loved seeing Brooklyn Brough again) Lila's family and Glenn's family had lots of interesting idioscracies that were \"touched\" on but I would have liked to see more time spent on.

Strauli was encouraged by Leonard Rossiter to play his character as the original actor would have; however the young actor (who had been at RADA with Beckinsale) felt uncomfortable with this suggestion as his contemporary had died only relatively recently. He would recall the part as an extremely unhappy one for him, despite the affability of the director and of the rest of the cast, but reasoned that his strained relationship with Rossiter was due to him feeling unsettled by Straulie replacing the much-missed Beckinsale.",

The only semi-serious issue is that movie was obviously shot in Hamilton pretending to be Manhattan. However, the usage of the stock NYC footage was minimal compared to the excessive use in the past few years in the many ROE TV movies.Cast is passable. I never watched Anna Hopkins before. She was convincing. Ryan Bruce not so much. I liked Dianne Aguilar, and Ed Pinker as he's a real Brit.What ruined this TV movie for me is writing. In the first half, I seriously tought this is some kind of parody about European royalty. After all, prince has Freddie name (what?!), and basically nothing can be taken seriously. Still passable, but around the half, movie started to take itself seriously. The only good thing is that Anna Hopkins killed as Nina for the all wrong reasons which is obviously not her fault. Act III is a one giant insult.Just watch trailer to save your valuable free time as this is ROE, and for some reasons it reveals the whole movie.",

When it was initially shown to Warner Brothers executives, they told Bakshi that they loved it. A week later, they told Bakshi that the idea of having live-action and animated characters in the same frame would never work, as it was too unbelievable. Warner executives also referenced the controversy from Bakshi's film \"Coonskin\" (1975). He was forced to throw out all the live action footage and reanimate it. Bakshi, having to pay himself, took five more years to complete it around other projects before its official release in 1982.",

Two older men who's maybe just starting to discover new things about themselves (yay!). Nothing wrong about that and I support.Then as the film goes on it becomes quite clear that the focus is not at all on self-discovery and growth as a person. Maybe the film tries to make it feel like it but no. They end up going in circles, discussing identity and emotions with people who either doesn't support how they feel or focused on the wrong thing.I just wanted to scream at them to stop listening to their idiot partners and other people in their lives and just go talk to someone who knows! Now we just had people with 0 experience with being queer (or different) trying to confide in people with 0 experience as well. Just making up baseless theories and ending with the annoying conclusions. Never truly understanding and leaving the MCs feeling bad because of it.If this was the point of the film, to just be frustrating and toxic, amazing you managed to do it. The dialogue is on point and quite entertaining. But do I feel like they did a good representation of queer people and show a healthy way to handle your emotions? No. Not at all.If they would have at least added something to show how it goes very bad in the long run and how unhealthy it is, I would have loved it. But now it's stuck in a gray zone of nothing being solved properly and the characters deem it manageable so they ignore it and move on. The film makes it feel like this is an okay conclusion. I don't think that's okay! That's toxic.Please, go talk to professionals. And please don't be scared to explore your sexual- or gender identity just because the people around you don't understand it.With love from someone queer <3.",

This means you have to put up with a lot to establish a life and get on, and thus it was so. The whinging and moaning about everything is not consistent with getting on.It is a bizarre story line that Ivar keeps pushing Robert to come out of the closet and/or acknowledge him in public when surely just to have met someone be having fun together is the main thing. To be revealed in this place and at that time would have been the end of everything.We had some committed acting however subtitles always make things seem more profound than they are. Robert is 19 I can't see the need for the script to rush his story it didn't add anything.I'm giving this a 6 outta 10 I was well worth watching.",

They separated in 1909, although they remained good friends who cared deeply for each other until his passing. She was also not quite the social outcast depicted in the film. Other aspects of her life that were missing from the movie: they had two children, a son and daughter. Margaret Brown was a passionate social crusader and philanthropist; she was a champion of women's rights, including education and the vote. She championed workers' rights, historic preservation, education and literacy, and child welfare, including helping to found the modern juvenile court system. After the sinking of the Titanic, she was noted for her efforts to commemorate the heroism of the men aboard the ship. After WWI, she helped to rebuild France and to aid wounded soldiers, and received the French Legion of Honor. She also ran twice for the U.S. Senate. She died in 1932.",

All kidding aside though, it is a character flaw if you want to call it that. And she does like to have fun - though only with someone she chooses too.

The chemistry between the leads Ayça Aysin Turan (Sahra) and Ekin Koç is perfect. From the moment of the their reunion to the moment of their bond is all built up beautifully. The film still holds a certain cheesiness to it, but it works. I truly enjoyed the exoticness of not the middle of nowhere USA. For me it's hard to grasp the full emotion of the film as I get distracted from reading the subtitles, but I catch myself appropriately and the emotional moments are still touching despite having to switch between reading words and seeing the visual cues.Thanks to a friend I've been trying to get myself more into foreign films and expand my genres and taste. This is one film I am definitely happy I checked out. It's perfect for a cuddle night on the couch. The build-up is good and the story works out to a tee. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a romcom that's a little fresh.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",

You will drive yourself to the set. If you are unable to drive yourself, a driver will pick you up, but you will probably become the subject of ridicule. Either way, you must arrive alone.3. There will be no craft service, so you should arrive on set \"having had\". Meals will vary in quality.4. You will pick, provide, and maintain your own wardrobe.5. You will create and maintain your own hair and make-up.6. There will be no trailers. The company will attempt to provide holding areas near a given location, but don't count on it. If you need to be alone a lot, you're pretty much screwed.7. Improvisation will be encouraged.8. You will be interviewed about your character. This material may end up in the film.9. You will be interviewed about the other characters. This material may end up in the finished film.10. You will have fun whether you want to or not. If any of these guidelines are problematic for you, stop reading now and send this screenplay back where it came from.",

They list the songs and there are a bunch of Christmas songs. Very confusing! It's as if they intended for it to be a Christmas movie and then changed their minds. Very odd! I always like Hayley Duff in a movie, but I would pass on watching this one again. There were some cute moments and she generally had chemistry with her romantic lead.

It is these questions the movie asks, that are quite riveting and that are really relatable.I am a bit surprised this has such a low rating and I have a bit of an affection towards Korean movies from the get go, so maybe I am biased. But as mentioned this really does not just go for society as a whole (not only the upper class, though they are the \"main\" target), but really focuses on the personal level and sacrifices when it comes to the way to the top ... The ending may be something that people will disagree with, but I liked where it went and I liked the realness of the characters too (flaws and all)",

And boy was I mesmerised. A young woman and a middle-aged man are in love and they spend the night together in a spa store where the former works. The things they talk about and dream about are enough to melt me or anyone who's loved someone before. But the way the film moves after that triggers melancholia that is hard to ignore. Blue Sun Palace is a profound film about loneliness and the way it captures desolation and depression and helplessness is bound to tear you up. It's a film that you want to escape from but once you do you'll keep thinking about it. The man character and his dreamy attitude is something I want to mimic.(Watched at the 2024 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)",

Working as a journalist in Europe, she interviewed Adolf Hitler in Vienna in 1933 and then vowed to fight against his persecution of Jews. After the fall of France in 1940, Mrs. Wake became a French Resistance courier and later a saboteur and spy, setting up escape routes and sabotaging German installations, saving hundreds of Allied lives. She worked for British Special Operations and was parachuted into France in April 1944 before D-Day to deliver weapons to French Resistance fighters. At one point, she was top of the Gestapo's most wanted list. \"Freedom is the only thing worth living for. While I was doing that work, I used to think it didn't matter if I died, because without freedom, there was no point in living\", Mrs. Wake once said of her wartime exploits. It was only after the liberation of France that she learned her husband, French businessman Henri Fiocca, had been tortured and killed by the Gestapo for refusing to give her up. She was Australia's most decorated servicewoman, and one of the most decorated Allied servicewomen of World War II. France awarded her its highest honor, the Legion D'Honneur. She also received Britain's George Medal, and the U.S. Medal of Freedom. In 2004, she was made Companion of the Order of Australia. She died in London on August 8, 2011 at the age of ninety-eight.",

The sex symbol's two-minute cameo was shot under great personal distress, however. Filmed in mid December 1966, at the time Zoltan Hargitay, Mansfield's youngest son with Mickey Hargitay, was recovering from spinal meningitis at Conejo Valley, California Community Hospital, after undergoing brain surgery resulting from his being mauled by a lion in a freak accident at the Jungleland Park in Thousand Oaks, California, on November 26, 1966. Zoltan spent exactly one month in the hospital, returning home to Jayne's \"Pink Palace\" on that year's Christmas morning. Though several Mansfield films were released after her untimely death six months later, the scenes in this one were, as an actress, her final moments before the professional movie cameras.",

He said, 'I have an idea, may I help on this?' I said, 'Please do,' and he suggested, 'Let her take the earring off herself, so he can nuzzle her ear.' So we did, and it made a terribly funny moment. Later in the scene she had to pour champagne down Peter Lawford's neck. We only have four shirts for Peter Lawford, so we could only shoot four takes, and it was tricky for the camera. On the last take I said, 'Judy if you laugh, I'll just kill you, I'll kill you dead.' Well, she didn't laugh, but she giggled, and it was absolutely great. I asked if she'd done it deliberately, in spite of what I'd said, and she didn't really know. Sometimes you get these very human things on the set.\"",

            "storyline": "A Perfect Christmas Carol (2023) -The films of this 2023 festive run seem to be bringing in a selection of new men and I'm not sure that I'm totally in to that, because I'm still very much a fan of the regulars like Luke Macfarlane, Andrew W. Walker and Jesse Hutch. In this one I was introduced to Preston Vanderslice who played Max and he already seemed too old to have a healthy chance of going forward each year to churn out 2 or 3 films for every season and holiday. He could end up being one of the older supporting cast very quickly.As such, it was also hard to find him attractive, which is where I tend to lose interest in these made for TV specials. The leading men are ultimately the goal of the story after all, with the ladies doing what they can to let them in, so if I don't buy that, I can't really enjoy the journey.I also wasn't a fan of Carol played by Stephanie Bennett, mostly because of her quite obnoxious character, but also because her acting wasn't brilliant either. Her best friend Benji (Carly Fawcett) was really terrible though and stood out so awkwardly. It was mostly her interactions that put me right off watching this all the way through. She was far too hyper and \"Extra\". I was also sure that Max should have recognised her when she turned up at his Mothers house.And the Mother was an absolute cow. He needed to see that about her.Carol's idea that she would try to steal the recipe from the matriarch was ludicrous from the absolute beginning.Other than that, the timeline seemed a bit off, with her going to his families house for Christmas to get a recipe for the restaurants menu to be sold before the big day? I didn't find out any more than that before I had to give up on it and find something more enjoyable to enrich my life with instead.Unscored as unfinished.-IMDB did not have the full listings to add all of the actors names at the time of writing this review.",

Also, as seen in the shot after John accepts the pills for the first time, The Beatles are performing \"Long Tall Sally\" like crazed maniacs with eyes bulging and sweating profusely. The reason for this is that the uppers were actually prescription-strength \"speed\" pills. According to all of The Beatles in various interviews (most prominently in the \"Beatles Anthology\" film and book), the band was forced to perform up to eight hours a night, far and away more than a band can possibly play given the normal fatigue that sets in from singing and playing. Whenever they grew tired, the bartenders or the waitresses would often give them (and other performers) uppers to keep them going. Because of this, and their horrible living conditions in the Kaiserkeller Club's back room, The Beatles were often sweaty, smelly, pale and shockingly thin (speed pills back then doubled as diet pills) because they rarely bathed, hardly ever washed their clothes or, more importantly, ate healthy meals. However, after Stuart Sutcliffe began dating Astrid Kirchherr, she would feed the band and wash their clothes and allow them access to her bathroom for bathing. All of The Beatles have said that Astrid, more or less, kept them alive and healthy.",

Adding insult to injury, the cast (to my untrained eye) seems made up of Filipino or Thai performers, not Chinese.Perhaps the worst aspect of this flop is Joe's re-use of some footage, styled as a flashback wherein a Princess and her lover jump to their death rather than be captured by guards, played over & over & over, obvious padding condoned under the rubric of \"dream sequences\".The dead lover is supposedly centuries later the head of a kamasutra religious cult, which gets hold of Joan and tortures her sexually for the duration of the film.It' very poorly shot and edited, sort of a destitute man's imitation of similar junk made (over & over again) by the likes of Jean Rollin and Jess Franco. If this were a round-robin elimination tournament to select the best of the worst, poor D'Amato would be gone, simply for poaching.Only reason to suffer through this exceedingly boring opus is to feast one'e eyes on Emerald, a porn version of Jacqueline Bisset. How such a classy looking dame got shanghaied into this free trip to Bangkok or Manila is beyond me, but I had visions of a porn remake of THE DEEP as my mind wandered from the non-action on screen.Supporting cast of Oriental performers does a poor job, with the various women hired to adore and finger \"Princess\" Emerald in the ritualistic lesbian scenes looking completely uninterested and incompetent. Forget about Joe -wasn't there an a.d. or an extras-wrangler on the set who could yell some encouragement to these lumps of flesh. It reminded me of the haven't-got-a-clue black island studs Joe non-directed in his XXX '70s movies.",

Gutierrez delivers a charismatic performance, bringing warmth, comfort, and a sense of security to the story.The cast as a whole is great! Striking the right balance between humor and heart. Courtney Gains, for instance, adds some fun with his comedic timing, but also brings depth to the story. Everyone delivers solid performances that keep you hooked, all of them are very talented.One of the standout elements is how the film handles family conflict. The team family games are such a fun and creative way to build tension while revealing the characters' truths and struggles.Eliana Ghen is one of the biggest highlights. She gives an emotional and authentic performance, making her character's journey engaging and believable. Eliana also brings her talent to writing, and I'm truly excited to see her upcoming projects!The film radiates dedication and love in every detail, you can really feel the care that went into making it!So It's a perfect pick for anyone looking for something fresh and heartfelt for the holidays. And the plot twist? Totally caught me off guard-in the best way!",

The original title and original Iorga spelling were both restored to the film by the 1990s, but all prints of it were still identical to the original 1970 release. Apparently, no additional footage survives from its original porn version of it at all and it is unknown if said version was actually filmed or, if it was filmed, whether or not it was finished or even released if it was (it is worth noting, however, that the characters often pronounce the Count's name within the film as \"Iorga\" (ee-yor-ga) and not as \"Yorga\" (yor-ga)).",

I certainly hope this film is shown not just nationwide, but worldwide. It's a great escape from all the nasties going on in the world, and the pressures in our lives. We all dream of living on an island, basking in the sunshine, and being served cocktails by the pool. 'He Loves Me Not' is not only a great showcase of the Fraser Coast region, but it reminds us to chill out and not take things too seriously. You'll leave the cinema with a great big smile on your face!",

The story starts off in Virginia and his dead grandmother leaves the Embry character a house in the East Hamptons. He is a writer and he heads to New York and adventure. He meets another young man, who is not exactly Mister Right but a sort of attachment starts. No spoilers except to say the sexuality between them was not coy, and refreshingly open and honest. All the cast was good and I must single out Bianca Rutigliano as a very believable loving friend who would not run out on him. Shamefully I am the only second person to review. I expected quite a few more. It is a film that will linger in my mind. More visibility is needed for good LGBT themed films like this.",

The protagonist possesses sufficient charisma to engage the audience, fostering a sense of attachment. However, if this was the film's primary ambition, it is a rather modest one.Ultimately, the film emerges as another project that prompts discussions about its unrealized potential. The principal flaw, in my opinion, lies within the script. Crafting dialogues for a specific group, complete with their unique slang, catchphrases, syntactic structures, and onomatopoeia, is a formidable task. However, the script's shortcomings are not confined to this aspect alone. The dialogues lack depth and are superficial, failing to provide any meaningful insight into the characters. The supporting characters serve merely as ornamental props, and even the protagonist is portrayed as shallow and unremarkable. The narrative, in the end, is more trivial than endearing. While the film does identify intriguing dilemmas faced by a white gay man in São Paulo, it addresses them in such a sterile, artificial, and uninspiring manner that it seems like an antiseptic portrayal of a complex reality.Possibly due to the script, the performances at times appear awkward. Certain dialogues between the trio of friends become cringe-inducing due to the weak writing. The attempt to represent a specific group of young people from São Paulo ends up feeling like a caricature verging on the comedic. We learn very little about any of the characters, other than their professions in cinema and their habit of drinking coffee. Their primary dilemma is their struggle with relationships-a rather universal issue.Furthermore, it is almost imperative for any film set in São Paulo to exhibit visual beauty, necessitating proficient cinematography. However, this film manages to be aesthetically displeasing in both its photography and art direction. With few exceptions, the film fails to capture the city's visual allure, which, in my opinion, is yet another flaw attributable to the script. The city's chaos is dialectically intertwined with each character's inner turmoil. Daily routines such as cohabitation, waking early, visiting cafes, shopping at markets, attending the cinema, and returning from trips-all these events occur within a space-time framework that is not integrated into the story. When time is incorporated, it is through an unsuccessful attempt to explore various possible realities.In conclusion, I finished watching the film without understanding what the \"13 feelings\" refer to.",

Producer David O. Selznick subsequently cut the film to two hours and five minutes, and then to its present length of one hour and fifty-four minutes, in which Barrymore's screen time totals about three minutes. In 1980, a flood reputedly destroyed the original, uncut version, making the restoration of the cut scenes unlikely, although it has been reported that some of these cut scenes reside at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York.",

            "storyline": "Have said many times about my love of Christmas and getting a lot of pleasure out of in particular watching films, cartoons and specials during this period, something that most years has been much needed. Wanted to see some more festive films that were more recent, lower in budget and were not childhood favourites, so in a way to broaden my horizons and have been doing so since November 2019. The idea sounded nice and a couple of the plot strands had a good deal of potential.Potential that is not really done anything with. There are a few good things but also unfortunately too much bad for me to recommend. As far as Christmas films go, there are certainly far worse out there that fare even worse in the acting and storytelling stakes. There are also a lot better, that have a lot more charm and spark. There have actually been some good Christmas films out there seen in the past four years, so me disliking 'Mistletoe and Molly' is not being said with bias.'Mistletoe and Molly' does have a few good things. It is an attractive looking film, with the scenery being beautiful. The soundtrack is pleasant and suitably festive.There are moments of easy going charm with Zach Smadu.Unfortunately that is pretty much it. Eden Broda's acting is limited to about two expressions, the most frequent one being that of being perpetually stunned. She and Smadu have no spark or chemistry together, too distant, and the relationship never develops. The supporting cast are poor, with a lot of wooden, motionless line delivery going on. Especially Shane Marriott. The chemistry between the whole cast is disconnected and none of the characters are fleshed out enough to care, just bland. The direction is routine.Furthermore, the writing is too often stilted and forced especially in the very slow going beginning. Tonally, it's unfocused, taking itself too seriously to be light hearted and the lack of interesting characters and underwritten storytelling stops it from having any charm or heart. The story is predictable, when there is signs of any, and is very dully paced. There was potential for the film to have a lot of heart, like the father and daughter relationship, but that also doesn't develop and feels shoehorned in at a point in the story where the placement feels awkward. Anything to give the female lead character development is practically neglected after being briefly introduced, so the film feels incredibly bland and incomplete feeling as a result.All in all, dull and has very little to it. 3/10.",

How, or even whether, these stories are going to intersect isn't clear at first - as in many of Manchevski's movies, you're never quite sure where it's going until he's ready to let you know - but Manchevski gives us characters to care about and root for in this offbeat love story.",

To me it's always fun when they get to live a normal life for a while. I enjoy the couple little repeat characters, Betty and Teddy. Betty isn't as exaggerative as she is in Good Witch, which is a good thing, and Teddy is fun to see without a European accent. She can do it all and she's beautiful. I hope she stars in one soon. As always, I love when there's more than just the one kiss at the end, makes it more of a believable love story.",

I see a bit more of the reasons why the side story is included in all of these Danube films, but that doesn't mean it's a great addition. However, it's not a bad movie in and of itself (aside from the weird Danube continuation aspects), so I'll give it 7 stars. The kisses were good, I'll give it that.The older woman who basically lives on this cruise ship is sort of a person of fate. She falls in love in every movie, but declines to take her love(s) to the next level. It's a bit of an odd concept. I wonder if they are making her out to be an angel of sorts, and it's her job to help the leads find their true love, all the while sacrificing her own in the process, because maybe she is atoning for something from her past. I don't know, but she keeps saying she must see the world, as if she has a mission, but she's on this particular cruise over and over, and this cruise does not equate to seeing the world. And so that is what I'm left with after seeing three of these films.This film features the usual romance, this time instead of a prince it's a celebrity. He's an American born actor who is about to hit the big-time. His career will explode if he caters to his fans on this cruise. He needs to rub shoulders, show that he loves his fans and is not some sort of recluse. He's been having difficulties acclimating to being a big star.She is also an American, a publicist. She's recently lost her job. We also have the female cruise director, or concierge, or whatever you call that person who greets people onto the ship and takes care of all the official stuff. She is in all of the Danube films. She always knows one of the leads. She invites her \"bestie\", the lead female, to help the movie star and be his temporary publicist on the cruise. Again, you see the whole fate aspect.And so I conclude this river cruise is considered a cruise of fates. Ok, we get it, and so it's just a little fantasy to sprinkle on the romance. But the side-show act detracts from the depth of the primary romantic theme, and what remains is half of an entertaining love story and half a circus. The second film was the best so far, this one is second best, the first one was well below average. I would say go ahead and watch them all, but don't expect much, except the second one has a few good moments.",

What does that mean? I've never been to drama school, I'm a fraud!' And then (writer/director Nicole Holofcenter) wrote this scene, and I was madly in the moment. There was never less of a gap between me and the character I was playing. I was as vulnerable, as brave, as stupid, as naked, as everything.

It was widely known that the lead role had been turned down by Marlon Brando, who had garnered three Academy Award nominations and was awarded one Oscar under Kazan's direction at the beginning of his film career and was the heart and soul of some of Kazan's best work as a movie director. By the late 1960s, after a string of flops, most critics felt Brando was through as a movie star and that he desperately needed Kazan to turn his career around, both as an artist and as a box-office star. When the film came out, Kirk Douglas' lead performance was roundly panned, and most critics felt that even Brando at his best couldn't save what was, in essence, a melodramatic potboiler. The failure of \"The Arrangement\" was the end of Kazan's own career as an A-list director.",

Unfortunately, with the camera's 48mm lens that close to the human face, pores tend to resemble craters on the surface of the moon. Borrowing on aspects of the magic lantern, Mamoulian devised a large, ruler-shaped, glass filter strip that was clear at one end, becoming increasingly more diffused along its length. With this glass filter mounted in front of the lens, as the camera moved in on Garbo, the glass strip was gradually drawn through the filter holder, beginning with the clear end, and ending with the diffused end (closeup), softening Garbo's facial features with more flattering results.",

Being a Vidyut Jammwal movie, actions can be expected & movie delivers the action but not a commercial way of execution...Its a blend of Vidyut Jammwal signature action plus the character natural action which can be conceived to the audience...As its highly based on emotion, it cannot be said in a commercial film making and so many times a second thought it was good to watch it over an OTT platform as when required it could be paused.Faruk Kabir portrays the customary grey topic of woman atrocities in his own style....Shivaleeka Oberoi performance was quite good but her screen presence is restricted as here a question might rise1) When an attrocity happens against a women why always men are crucified ?? Do she also have the responsibility to fight??Overall a movie based on emotion which could be watched over a big screen to feel the experience knowing that it couldn't be paused when experiencing a lagness...",

Rachel was in another solid Hallmark movie this year called Moriah's Lighthouse and Niall was in a really great Hallmark movie this year called Rip in Time.This is NOT another cookie cutter Hallmark movie. It's an engaging lost and found story that was somewhat reminiscent of The Christmas Note and My Christmas Family Tree (2 great Hallmark movies that explored the emotional impact of having a complicated and incomplete family history).The Secrets of Bella Vista is based on the novel The Apple Orchard by New York Times bestselling author Susan Wiggs and ties a key plot point about old historical items to the escape, by Tess' grandparents, from Nazi-occupied Denmark during World War II. Tess, unaware of this history, coincidentally has an interesting job as a high end art and antiques expert in San Francisco. She's presented as someone too busy to even eat. Just as I was getting annoyed with Tess, I realized the script had given her a believable back story of abandonment that explained most of her actions (with one glaring exception). I also found the explanation for the Orchard's financial problems to be surprisingly credible.I was drawn in by the story and appreciated the careful plot details that made this a (mostly) believable family mystery. I cared about Tess and Isabel (warmly played by Helena Marie) and was grateful that this wasn't a story of scheming and back stabbing beneficiaries. In fact, Tess was unrealistically portrayed as too far on the other end of the spectrum.Specifically, it's revealed at the beginning that she's inherited half of a big apple orchard property, home and business near Napa that she thinks is worth as much as $20 million. And yet she flippantly tells the banker she doesn't want it and is willing to sign it over to a newly discovered family member she's never met.Really??She's supposedly only 30 years old (which the radiant 43 year old Lefevre pulls off) and though she seems successful, how rich could she possibly be? And who just walks away from what seems like a huge inheritance? Heck, she could have sold her share and donated the proceeds to Ukraine War Relief. Her lack of interest in her inheritance was wildly unrealistic.But that was just one of only a few off key notes in an otherwise entertaining and enjoyable movie.Random Observations:The growing (and wonderful) relationship between Tess and Isabel seemed believably warm and healthy for both of them.I've heard the phrase \"bankers' hours\", but the banker in this movie really never seemed to work.There's a bad outdoor green screen scene at the orchard that looks more fake than most.There's a terrible, and terribly misplaced, song that plays over the pie baking scene with lyrics that include \"we don't need money no, we don't need money for rainy days. We don't need anyone\". Ugh. But the scene was cute.I love Hallmark's increasing inclusion of LGBTQ characters without having their lifestyle being the source of any drama.Hoping to see Rachel Lefevre again in another Hallmark movie soon.",

He wrote the script for the movie, which never got made, but in the process he became friends with Stan Lee. They started socializing and going out for dinner and going to each other's homes. Sometimes we would go out with Bob Kane, the creator of Batman. He had a great time with these guys. When Cohen made this film he said to Stan: \"I think I'm going to make this character a cartoonist who works for Marvel. I asked him to play himself. He was really anxious to do it. It was the only time Stan has had some real scenes to play in a movie and some real dialogue. In the Marvel pictures he's mostly a walk-on or an extra. With me he had a real character to play, even if it was the part of Stan Lee. We maintained our friendship over the years.\"",

We first see him growing up during the war. Then he himself serves in the army and begins to build his career. It was not easy for him, but he went towards his goal no matter what.A very important part of the film is the rescue of the hostages. Several armed bandits captured a bus with schoolchildren and a teacher. They demanded a large ransom and the opportunity to escape abroad. They must be stopped by Zaitsev and his task force.This is one of the most tense moments of the film. Here everything may not go according to plan and then there will be victims. Zaitsev took full responsibility for carrying out the rescue mission. And although you can read on the Internet how it all ended, I strongly recommend watching the film in a cinema.I think this film is worth watching. It is based on real events and boasts unique revelations from the book of the real General Zaitsev. So it's definitely worth a look.",

Winters begrudgingly agreed and on the next day when they were preparing to shoot, Winters had Vince meet her on set in front of the cast and crew. Winters told Vince of all the famous people she's worked with, including Gene Hackman and Stanley Kubrick and the insults she called them, telling Vince that he now joined a long list of respected Hollywood people that she had insulted.

Return To Sender gifts us with a bit of magical casting that goes a long way to make us want to stay and come back for more. Huge Kidos to the Director for some really great characters and relationships that give us something that feels genuine right of the bat - and keeps delivering. We get a great coupling up with the central pair Meg and Ollie - a well matched clash of determinations and affection orbited by the many possibilities of a hapless younger brother in a freefall relationship caper , a great podcast duo on the precipice of a friend zone highwire tragedy, and an absolutely delightful throughline of the wonderfully cast and quirky Giselle / who charmingly imparts drops of wisdom and draws the young lovers together as the \"semi psychic\" whimsical mage. A pleasant surprise to be drawn into such a charming and uplifting little universe that feels like you want to see so much more of these characters in such a short time. Definitely worth the watch!!!",

Leigh was aware of his opposition, which he expressed openly at a rehearsal, and he says that did not help the chemistry between the two of them. (More would have preferred Peggy Ashcroft with whom he had appeared in the original play - she was less glamorous and older). The 2011 remake resolutely de-glamorizes everything.",

Such alliances born of serendipity can also fall at a whim too and the ups and downs are charted very well. The story is told in slow reveal flash backs which is a nice touch.Now I was not sure if I like this or not, it is well acted and filmed and it ticks so many boxes – it is mostly in English though and Alessia seems to have very little French but there is some. The story is all well and good but I just saw it at first as hedonistic, self absorbance and so found it hard to connect. That said it is a giver of a film and so very much worth bearing with.",

So this is a chance for his fans to see him as a normal person in a romantic role. Im Soo Jung looks too goofy the whole time with her eccentric get up and granny glasses and over curly hair. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. He looks like he is modelling the latest mens wear coats and turtlenecks perfectly groomed and with perfect hair. In contrast she looks like a blast from the past. No one in their forties can get away with that grungy look droopy glasses and over permed hair. No reason to fall in love is shown in the movie. There is little build up in the relationship or even signs of attraction. The first almost kiss on the street was totally unromantic. And Esom who plays his first love looks even less likely to have had an affair with him. Why didn't they pick actresses to better match his looks like Seo Ji Hye or Han Hyo Joo? At least then the main couple would have looked good together.A bunch of familiar faces in supporting roles including Lee Sang Yi looks unrecognisable with the glasses. He shows off singing talent.The pseudo drama at the end is such a non event. What was there to be mad about? Then his acceptance of the issue was unexplained.One thing about the subtitles which were in white and often played out on a light background so they were often difficult to read.Fans of LDW will like this movie but for others it may be lacking in substance even for a rom com.",

This is mere documentary-style window-dressing that fails to elevate standard softcore sex footage. Due to its 1970 date of production, the fans do get to sample full-frontal nudity and split-beaver shots, then all the rage.The direct sound dialog is throwaway, with moaning & groaning emphasized. A crappy library music score is no help whatsoever in maintaining interest. After an OK lesbian scene, filmmakers desperately dish out that old standby, an orgy, involving 10 players, but it's too late to serve as a wakeup call. For the umpteenth time, a not-so-clever ploy at the finale has \"THE END\" displayed superimposed on a girl's bare behind.Adding insult to the potion, AHC transcribes this junker from a badly damaged print. Some of my all-time favorites including Sue Peters and Uschi Digard are completely wasted here, plus Tommy Toole (the star that year of the classic TOMATOES), inevitable John Holmes, hard-working John Dullaghan, and representing the over-the-hill generation, the obnoxious Michael Donovan O'Donnell.",

When this one works, the zany scenarios and full-throttle energy provide a lot to enjoy here. The escalating situations that arise from the chase to get her back, following up an equally silly meet-cute that brought them together, shows him and his friend meeting up with a well-meaning loser hitchhiking across the country, inept police officers more interested in beating innocent bystanders than dispensing justice, hippie figures living in the woods, and many more bizarre individuals that allow for a genuinely thrilling time here wondering who's the next participant encountered. This meshes nicely with the song-and-dance routines that introduce some fun genuine laughs provided the proper mood and mindset are established. However, when that's not met, the film is a struggle and chore to get through. Being nearly two hours is a huge part of that, but this type of over-the-top comedy might not appeal to all out there. The exaggerated mannerisms, over-the-top characterizations of bizarre individuals in this universe, and increasingly zany scenarios featured throughout here might not always be funny which is where this one spends the majority of the time so hoping that the situation doesn't become a drag is a tall ask. This becomes a lot more tolerable when it's running through the more traditional if overly formulaic backwoods cannibal family that she has to survive with long enough for the boyfriend to save her which isn't that bad as the majority of this one is reserved for the personal preference towards the comedy.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",
