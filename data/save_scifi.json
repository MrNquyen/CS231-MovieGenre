The next film, tentatively titled 'Alien: Awakening', was set to enter preproduction that same month, but according to some sources, the project was shelved indefinitely. The commercial underperformance of Alien: Covenant as well as its lukewarm reception by critics and fans were named as reasons, although no official statements were made by Disney. In early 2019, however, the script called Alien: Awakening was actively being written, and Untitled Alien Prequel was officially in production as of 2022.",

Jackman also made Schreiber add a great deal of protein to his diet, which Schreiber called \"the genocide of chickens.\" In the end, Schreiber gained forty pounds, and had to buy several new suits due to his back gaining several inches in width: \"I can't fit into my favorite suit now.

Cameron requested Dr Frommer that the Na'vi language must be entirely new, as it's supposed to be from another planet, and that it should sound \"nice\" to the audience. Cameron didn't want any additional editing done to their voices and wanted them to sound authentic and not unnatural. Equipped with a vast knowledge of linguistics, Dr Frommer understood what kinds of sounds the Na'vi language would or wouldn't have. Just like \"j\" and \"r\" don't exist in Korean, in English, the 'h' sound is unaspirated. In a similar vein, Frommer's conception of the new language totally avoided the sounds of \"ch\", \"th\", and \"sh\". Additionally, Frommer had to decide on the language's syntax -- or rules regarding word order. He came up with his own set of constraints and words to be used in the language of Pandora. The tongue took inspiration from the natural languages of the world to create a totally different spoken form.",

The actors are not horrible, but here their performance is flat, and their chemistry is non-existent.Adam Stern's got some hurdles to overcome before he can deliver a real blockbuster. For now, it's a niche indie film, likely drawing in Cara Gee fans from The Expanse, but unlikely to reach a broader audience.Watch if you are a hardcore indie/sci-fi fan, I don't think I would recommend this otherwise it's just a dull watch.

The percentage of the audience who liked the movie fell into the mid-30s, and executive producer Mario Kassar felt that the main problem was that the plot made zero sense. Producer Dean Devlin noted that Jaye Davidson's struggle with drugs and alcohol addiction negatively affected his performance as Ra, to the point where the audience didn't believe he was a genuine threat. The solution: change the Ra character into an alien inhabiting a human body, alter his dialogue, and subtitle it into information that presented a clearer storyline. When these changes were made, the subsequent test screenings produced an overwhelming majority of positive reviews, and this carried the movie into becoming one of the surprise hits of fall 1994.",

My father was not a fisherman.\"",

In all those years, Portman was promised the role of Sonmi-451, but had to turn down the role at the last minute after becoming pregnant in 2010; however, she is given a special thanks in the closing credits.",

It was surreal, because they would bus you in in the middle of the night, so you couldn't see any of the country. They would just drop you in this resort compound, which was in fact surrounded by a razor-wire fence. You couldn't leave, much like in the film, and there was a kind of fake town where you could go shopping. The Chinese restaurant and the horrible discotheque in the movie are both based on that actual resort; the scene with the man on the ATV on the beach being chased by guards actually happened. And then, at the end of the week, they bused you back during the day, and you could see the actual immediate surrounding country, which was very poverty-stricken. There were people living in shacks. That contrast was obviously horrible, but also surreal, because you realized you had never actually entered the country; you were just dropped into this strange pocket of a sort of alternate dimension that had just grown up to become this tacky Disneyland mirror image of reality.\"",

Contrary to popular belief, Spielberg claims he introduced many of the darker elements into the story, while Kubrick's main contribution consisted mostly of its \"sweeter\" parts. In a 2002 interview with movie critic Joe Leydon, Spielberg indicated that the middle part of the movie, including the Flesh Fair, was his idea, whereas the first forty minutes, the Teddy bear, and the last twenty minutes were taken straight from Kubrick's story. Ian Watson, who wrote Kubrick's original treatment, confirmed that even the much-criticized ending, assumed by many to be a typical Spielberg addition, was \"exactly what (he) wrote for Stanley, and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg.\"",

The project was officially announced in January 2021, but filming was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was scheduled to start in April 2022. In the meantime, Bonello directed the film Coma (2022) instead, which featured Ulliel in the last movie he filmed and the last work he finished. Ulliel passed away on January 19, 2022 following a skiing accident, and the filming for 'The Beast' was delayed again. In February 2022, Bonello told Variety that he would likely recast Ulliel's role with a non-French actor. On May 16, 2022, it was announced that British actor George MacKay was cast as the male lead and that filming was scheduled to start in August 2022.",

Worth wore parachutes concealed within their suits. The \"parachute\" over which they fight is actually a dummy chute, which had to be removed before the stuntman could use the real parachute underneath. Stuntman Jake Lombard would don and remove the dummy chute up to three times in a single jump. The actual parachutes used by the stuntmen had a main and reserve chute concealed within the suitcoats. A breakaway seam ran down the back, which allowed the parachute to be opened without the need to remove the coat. There were only sixty to seventy seconds of free fall time, between when the stunt performers exited the aircraft and when they had to activate their chutes. After factoring in the time needed to get the performers and cameraman into position after leaving their plane, only a few seconds of film could be shot per jump. Therefore, the entire sequence required eighty-eight jumps, and five weeks to film, just to produce the two minutes of footage in the final movie.",

Another goddamn stand-up comedian here to make fun of us at our sacred rituals.' Well, I'll have you know, I'm not such an outsider. I am quite sought after in the film world. I would like to share with you a real email that I got from my agents about thirty days ago. This is an actual email that they sent me on December 7th, [2023,] so you'll get an idea of who you're dealing with. 'John, in anticipation of our conversation, attached please find the untitled Maggie Gyllenhaal project written and to be directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.' That makes sense. 'Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Osnat Handelsman[-Keren], and Talia Kleinhendler are attached to produce for Warner Brothers. Christian Bale is negotiating to star opposite Jessie Buckley.' I know who one of those people is. 'There is no script available at this time.' Okay, I'm listening. 'Pending, pending your response to the material. Please use the attached sides to put yourself on tape for the role of Young Cop.' Let's, thank you. They really sent this to me. WME [the entertainment agency William Morris Endeavor] sent this to me, let me be clear. I'm not being OFFERED Young Cop. They're giving me the chance to throw my hat in the ring. And yes, I put myself on tape, and, no, I didn't get it, but. . . . Let's stop focusing on failure, all right? Enough failure. Tonight, there are only winners.\"",

ABC later broadcast an extended TV version that restored almost 40 minutes of deleted scenes, which explain more about the world, the people who live there, the Smokers' religious beliefs and their ability to refine crude oil. The additional scenes also tie up several loose ends in the theatrical release. Being a TV special, this version was also censored for violence and language. A fan-edit of the film, called 'Waterworld: The Ulysses Cut' (named after a restored scene at the end), was later made in an attempt to create the most complete version of the movie. It was compiled from several broadcast versions, containing all of the additional footage from the TV version while restoring the previously censored parts. In an unexpected turn, the original distributor officially sanctioned this fan-edit by releasing it in a box-set with the other two versions. This Ulysses Cut was remastered in high-definition though, created with original footage rather than lower-quality broadcast material.",

In addition to producing the creature effects, Cosmatos trusted Winston to direct the second unit action sequences. \"George Cosmatos always let us take the lead in how to shoot the creature,\" noted Landon. \"He was such a big-hearted person, he would throw up his hands, and say 'I don't know what I'm doing.' He'd just admit it and let us do what we knew how to do. We know what our characters can do and we know the best way to use them. We're thinking about what our characters are going to have to do on the set the entire time we're building them. So we are goldmines of information and knowledge.

In an interview for the E! True Hollywood Story documentary on the life of the actress, former boyfriend Billy Sheehan recounted how Wilsey was utterly humiliated during the film's premiere. Whenever the audience would laugh at one of her lines she could not differentiate whether they were laughing at her personally or the character. The experience forever marred Wilsey on a personal level and she soon afterwards resigned herself to pursue a career exclusively in the adult entertainment industry.",

Before the shoot, she called Connery and offered not to do the accent, but he insisted she should. Afterwards, she asked him what he thought. He replied, \"You were great!\" She was taken aback and asked if he really meant it. He said, \"Yeah, it's terrible! It's the worst impersonation I have ever heard, and it's perfect.\"",

Weighing only 8 pounds, the 35mm camera literally fit in the palm of the hand and featured interchangeable lenses, remote follow focus, and video assist (necessary since the camera had no viewfinder). The camera was then mounted on a SteadiCam-style portable rig, which gave the camera stability and mobility similar to the human eye.",

However, he considered the film an artistic failure because of its need for technological dialogue and special effects, which prevented it from transcending its genre; something he believed his movie Stalker (1979) did better.",

Set in a small country town, the film follows the story of Grace who, because of an experimental brain technology, is the only survivor of a car accident that claims the life of her parents.As Grace tries to recover back at her family home with the help of her friend Kate, she experiences unexpected symptoms from the implant and visions of a ghost that is trying to tell her something about what has happened to her. As her suspicions grow and the situation becomes more sinister, she is set on a journey to unravel the past and uncover the terror that is plaguing her.This is a great debut entry into the horror thriller genre. Created by a small Australian team, it achieves some excellent cinematography, with a number of unique and well executed shots adding to the appeal. The compelling story contains many different strands which weave together culminating in a final confrontation, and keeps you guessing until the end.Supported by excellent performances from local Australian actors, an atmospheric score and some great practical effects, Remnant is a testament to what can be achieved by small independent productions.Being a local film, I had been following along with its production and looked forward to the release. I had the pleasure of seeing it at the outdoor premiere in Mudgee and it was a great experience. It was fantastic to see how well the film turned out and to see people's reactions as we watched. There was a lot of chatter afterwards, and people discussing their theories on the ending. I am very much looking forward to seeing what Mike Horan and Outlaw Films have in store for us in the future.",

Several days later, Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki sent a katana sword to Weinstein's office with \"NO CUTS\" embedded into its blade. The movie was later released in the U.S. in its uncut version. During a later interview, Miyazaki commented on the incident by smiling and stating, \"I defeated him.\" Nausicaä was his only film to suffer heavy editing on first release. In 1995 the US rights returned to Miyazaki and he made a distribution deal with Disney. In 2003 a new English dub with Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman was released in the uncut 117 minute (1hr 57min) version. - James LaPierre WUD Films",

Huge parts of the plot were left out and even one character's sexuality of being gay was cut out by the studio.It's possible that this 71-minute version of the film was an R-rated version which some producers wanted. Despite Kusama's objections, alternate scenes were filmed which for example showed more bloodier fights and bullet hits, and more nudity from Charlize Theron in several of her scenes. In the end, they decided to go with PG-13 rating so violence and nude scenes were cut, including an entire sex scene, although you can still see several quick shots of Theron's breasts in post-sex scene.Kusama's original cut was about 30 minutes longer and it also had different score, composed by Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil, which was rejected by the producers and replaced with Graeme Revell's score while they were re-editing different versions of the film for test screenings. Trailers for the film show some of alternate scenes which could be from Kusama's director's cut, like Æon in different clothes after she wakes up.",

This disregard is deliberate. Just as they make fun of the victims, of people in a situation of weakness.

I felt there was maybe a few scenes it looked out of place or cheap but that was less than a few mins total(one example John on balcony on mars)Voice acting can't get much better either. Titus welliver as Rorschach. Rory Baker as Ozzy. Sally and the narrator also put in top tier performances..Great fight scenes coupled with lots of blood.and goreSit down and enjoy this 90 minute adaptation of a classic that I don't think anyone else has delivered.",

The crane malfunctioned and didn't move out of the way in time. Noticing this, she tried (and failed) to block it with her arm. She received several serious life threatening injuries including a twisted spine, broken discs, brain bleeding, shattered scapula, nerves torn, leaking cerebral fluid, degloved face (which is when facial skin is ripped off to reveal muscle tissue and teeth), shattered eye socket which had to be put together with tweezers, cheekbone shard stabbing her ear drum, fingers torn from her hand, an entire bone ripped out of her arm. Her left arm, which suffered these injuries, was injured so badly it had to be amputated. She was put into a medically induced coma for 17 days to perform all of the surgeries. Paul W.S. Anderson was so devastated by the accident that he nearly quit the project, while Milla Jovovich visited Jackson in the hospital and brought her flowers. Jackson sued (and won) the production company for the workplace injuries, as she was initially only compensated $33,000 for the injuries.",

Although both the story and acting were heavily criticized and Shyamalan decided to take the blame, Smith later shared his deep regret for involving his son in the movie: the press had released a vicious barrage of negative commentary aimed at Jayden, which hit the boy hard since he had only followed his father's instructions. Will added that Jayden understandably felt betrayed and misled for a while, and once even requested to be emancipated from his parents at age 15. He eventually decided against it.",

Director Barbara Peeters, who was a feminist who hated that idea, refused to shoot the scenes. Corman said he'd hire a second director and get her feedback before using the new footage. She agreed to that. But Corman ended up never showing the new footage to her or the cast and other crew. They didn't see them until the preview of the film. Peeters was furious, protesting that they were inserted purely to show gratuitous nudity. Corman also edited out many of the scenes dealing with the plot and character development in order to make room for the nudity and more creature scenes. Peeters complained that it was no longer the film she made and wanted her name taken off. Corman said he'd do that but only if she paid the expense of redoing the credits. She wouldn't, so her name stayed on the project. Many years later, Peeters ended up watching the film on cable and admitted it actually ended up being \"a fun little movie.\"",

The latter complained that early footage of the film wasn't scary enough, and would frequently visit the set to make unreasonable demands about what should be shot, deviating away from the script. When that did not solve the matter, Weinstein threatened to fire del Toro and replace him with another director. However, del Toro was saved by the intervention of Mira Sorvino, who was a recent Oscar winner for Mighty Aphrodite (1995) (produced by Weinstein's company Miramax). She threatened to quit the film if del Toro's vision wasn't respected, and she received support from her then-boyfriend Quentin Tarantino, who has made several films for Miramax. The Weinsteins finally agreed to let del Toro stay on, but they oversaw the final cut of the film. Since then, del Toro has never worked with the Weinsteins again, but he made his peace with the film after creating a Director's Cut that was closer to his vision.",

Making the casts, which involved being submerged in the very hot casting material with only a straw in their mouths to breathe through, was grueling for the actors, especially Carolyn Jones, who was claustrophobic. Dana Wynter recalled, \"I was in this thing while it hardened, and of course it got rather warm! I was breathing through straws or something quite bizarre, and the rest of me was encased, it was like a sarcophagus. The guys who were making it tapped on the back of the thing and said, 'Dana, listen, we won't be long, we're just off for lunch [laughs]!' In the end, we had to be covered except for just the nostrils and I think a little aperture for the mouth.\"",

There is a sequence involving an elevator shaft. We knew we couldn't film it in a real elevator shaft, so we had to figure out how to shoot something like that. There are always those types of creative challenges. Also, finding US Army vehicles in the middle of Budapest isn't the easiest thing to do! We managed to find a Humvee from Romania, which belonged to a private collector, and drove it to the locations. You write things like these into scripts so easily without thinking about how you're going to pull them off. It's only when you get into production that you start to think, 'Oh, what was I thinking when I wrote that.' We only have ourselves to blame at the end of the day!\"",

However, the locals were not happy to see the film crew in the area so they made the shoot very difficult by harassment and vandalism. Carpenter tells that while they were filming, for example, a sound take, a neighbor would start mowing his lawn or start up a chainsaw until he was paid to stop. Some of the people even tried to break into the equipment trucks. The whole experience essentially soured Carpenter on living in the area, where several scenes of his earlier film \"The Fog (1980)\" were also filmed.",

The plot of this splatter comedy would have centered around undead German WW2 soldiers coming from the sea and killing tourists at a beach. Production began in 2004, but by 2009 the project was officially abandoned and the team started to work on Frankenstein's Army instead. All that remains from Worst Case Scenario are two teaser trailers released in 2006 that feature some of the creatures that ended up being used in Frankenstein's Army more than ten years later.",

The first reanimated corpse is a guy named Peter Kent, Arnold's double. He's got those big muscles. He got Arnold to see Re-Animator and Arnold liked it so much that he had a screening of it in his home, inviting all of these people, including producer John Davis. John had the rights to Fortress and Arnold was going to do it. For some reason, I'm not sure why, Arnold finally decided that he wasn't going to do the movie and dropped out. They had a big budget, probably like 60 million, 70 million dollars, which was a huge budget in those days. Now it sounds small. [laughs] Anyway, he dropped out and the budget went down. They cut the budget to about 15 million dollars.\"",

Should I bring it for the production? Maybe we could use it.' We knew immediately how that would fit into our general approach to the photography of the movie. The photography should feel like an omniscient presence in the movie. It should feel very subjective, almost like a third, all-powerful character. So Will came out with the drone and, after almost getting arrested with it in a Moscow airport because they were thinking it was a piece of military equipment he was going to assault Russia with, we got to use it. Any day the crew was off, [co-director/cinematographer] Aaron Moorhead and I would continue to shoot. On Sundays in Italy, we'd continue shooting and that was when we'd do the drone photography with Will. Just grab as many shots as we could, experiment with it, see how it would work. And almost everything we shot with the drone made it into the edit. It's one of the talking points of the movie. It's pretty cool. It's one of those things where one day, because a lot of people have started using them and someday people are going to look at our movie and be like, 'Why did Moorhead and Benson use the fucking toy helicopter thing over and over and over again?'\"[2014]",

Furthermore, due to special effects house Digital Domain considering a partnership with MGM, production was supposed to get a discount on the special effects, but when that deal fell through, they had to pay for \"the full spa treatment\", and about half of the planned shots had to be scrapped. Hill also disagreed with MGN on their decision to screen his first cut without many of the effects shots for a test audience (which, as he predicted, was a disaster), and their refusal to allow for additional filming (which had to be done anyway after Hill walked out). In an interview years after the release, Hill said that his version was much darker, had a very different setup and that the ending was much different from the final cut. He also expressed strong dislike for the way the studio ruined the movie but said that James Spader did a great job with his role.",

One reason was because of the constant studio interference that didn't allow Carpenter much creative freedom. Carpenter also called Chevy Chase \"a director's worst nightmare\" and \"nearly impossible to direct\", also saying the same about Daryl Hannah. According to Carpenter, Chase would complain non-stop about the film's tone and hated wearing the special effects, often prematurely removing his makeup and ruining hours of filming. At one point, Carpenter broke a clipboard in half over his knee in a fit of rage when Chase removed his makeup mid-take. Carpenter said that Chase and Hannah were \"immune to any punishment from the studio, and they knew it, so they walked over me and everyone else on set and essentially told us we'd be replaced if we had any problem with them...it was like working with your boss's snooty children who would tattle on you if you didn't bend to their every will.\" Despite this, Carpenter ended up bonding and seeking comfort in Sam Neill over the troubling production and the two became close friends, with Neill agreeing to work with Carpenter again on In the Mouth of Madness (1994).",

            "storyline": "Trapped Inn isn't just a doomsday thriller; it's a visceral, unrelenting wake-up call to humanity. Through its stark portrayal of a collapsing world, the film doesn't simply tell a story; it hurls us headfirst into a reality that feels uncomfortably close. The tension builds with every scene, delivering a narrative that serves as a grim warning: we're teetering on the edge, and the choices we make now might be our last. While the drama is undoubtedly heightened for cinematic effect, Trapped Inn speaks to a deeper truth. The world depicted is the culmination of humanity's \"nickel-and-diming\" its way to oblivion-a society so consumed by short-term gain and apathy that it has reached a critical crossroads. In this world, mediocrity and complacency have calcified into a collective paralysis, trapping everyone in a prison of their own making. The metaphorical inn becomes a reflection of this entrapment, a place where survival is overshadowed by the looming realization that there might be no way out. Director Leah Sturgis masterfully captures the harsh reality that tough individuals often refer to with a grim shrug: survival in this world is merciless, and salvation doesn't come gift-wrapped. The film's characters are pushed to their limits, forcing us to confront an uncomfortable truth-our savior may very well look like the person staring back at us in the mirror. Self-reliance and hard choices, the film suggests, are the only way forward. The performances are raw and haunting, with Matt Rife delivering a standout portrayal of a protagonist grappling with internal and external collapse. The cinematography mirrors the bleakness of the narrative, offering unflinching shots of desolation and decay that make the stakes feel all too real. Yes, Trapped Inn is dramatic, perhaps even melodramatic at times. But isn't that the point? It's a cautionary tale dressed in adrenaline-pumping, edge-of-your-seat storytelling. It implores us to look inward and ask hard questions about where we're headed. If we fail to act, if we continue to prioritize mediocrity over meaningful change, the film's dystopian vision could very well become our harsh reality. In the end, Trapped Inn doesn't just entertain; it challenges us to face the uncomfortable truth that saving ourselves might be the toughest battle of all.",

Arad confirmed this in 2002, adding that he had been unaware of an upcoming Fantastic Four film until a fan mentioned it to him after noticing Arad's Fantastic Four shirt.

A few test scenes were shot before searching for financiers, which led Pyun to the Shah brothers at Imperial Entertainment. They agreed to bankroll the film on one condition: Alex had to be changed into an adult male and Olivier Gruner, their recent discovery, had to play him. Pyun agreed when the Shahs promised not to influence production in any other way. The concept of Alex being a woman was eventually used in the sequels, played by bodybuilder Sue Price.",

Craven filmed this version of the film and Warner Bros. decided to screen it to a test audience mostly consisting of Craven's fans. The response from fans was negative, criticizing the lack of violence and gore seen in Craven's previous films. The studio eventually discovered Craven's popularity as a horror film director. The president of Warner Bros. at the time, Mark Canton, demanded Rubin write six additional gore scenes into his script, each bloodier than the last. Rubin worked very hard with Craven to create a very deep and heartfelt movie out of it. Unfortunately, added gore scenes, re-shoots and post production re-editing of the movie heavily changed the original story. Craven and Rubin expressed strong anger at the studio and thus disowned the film.",

Assonitis, the film's producer and prolific film-maker. Assonitis had made a deal with a small label at Warner Bros. for a budget of $500,000 to produce the movie, provided that an American was credited as director. After considering Miller Drake as director but finding him unsuitable, he gave the job to Cameron after being impressed by his special effects on Galaxy of Terror (1981); but what he really wanted was a first-timer who he could easily side-step in order to take over as director, something he had already done on Beyond the Door (1974) and Madhouse (1981). According to \"Dreaming Aloud,\" a biography of James Cameron by Christopher Heard, and \"The Futurist\" by Rebecca Keegan, Cameron worked on the film's special effects, re-wrote the script, created storyboards, did location scouting and actually filmed for four days. However, Assonitis called most of the shots, continuously questioned Cameron's decisions, did not allow him to watch his own footage, and finally fired him on the fifth day of shooting, reportedly because Cameron's footage wouldn't cut together. Later, Cameron was able to convince Assonitis to show him a rough cut of the film, which was horrible, but not because there was anything wrong with his footage: Assonitis had simply manipulated the situation to re-write half the movie (adding nudity that wasn't in the script originally). Cameron then broke into the editing room every night for weeks, and cut his own version. Unfortunately, Assonitis found out and re-cut it again. The most widely distributed version of the film that is available on DVD is Assonitis' version, although Cameron was later allowed to create a director's cut that saw a limited release in some markets.",

Toji's younger sister is seen fully recovered in the film, but in the series, the fate of her is never know. In the film, Asuka is much more open with Shinji. For example, the scene of the series in which she lies beside him, she falls asleep and Shinji moves away, but the film she stays in bed and they counted each other's fears, with greater harmony between them that at other times. In the series, when the EVA-01 match against Zeruel, EVA-01 goes into Berserk mode alone, while in the film, Shinji does so at their own will. In the the series the EVA-01 also rebuilds the lost arm with a piece of Zeruel's ripped body, while in the film, the EVA 01 creates a sort of \"condensed energy arm\" which is also used as \"cannon momentum\" against Zeruel.",

I refused and Tisha did too. They still gave Tisha a very nice part but it was down hill after this for me. They made an issue out of me not willing to show my breasts, so they threatened that if I didn't do it they were going to cut me out of everything and they did.\" Gail Gilmore remembered this incident and said, \"They wanted us to show us popping out of our clothes and asked if we minded being nude for it during filming though we would cover our breasts with our arms. I never had any qualms with nudity so I readily said yes. Joy did too, but Vicki refused.\" Joy Harmon said that while she would never agree to being nude onscreen in a movie, she had no problem being nude on set for any role that called for it as long as the camera didn't see anything. She wasn't shy so it didn't bother her if actors or production crew saw her body. So when Gordon asked to see her breasts, it made sense why he was doing it and she wanted the bigger role, so she took off her top and let him look at her topless.",

Producer Shogo Tomiyama admitted that Godzilla 2000: Millennium was \"made abruptly\" since there were no plans to create another Godzilla film until 2005. But because of the failure of the TriStar film, Tomiyama said that studio felt that they \"couldn't keep silent until 2005\".",

In the 1980s, Charles Band Productions announced a sequel, tentatively titled \"Laserblast 2,\" about two boy scouts stumbling upon the weapon and terrorizing their hometown. The project was carried over to Band's later studio, Empire Pictures. For years, it was described as in development, partially completed, or fully completed. In the early 1990s, an ad in Variety offered full sale of the film rights, but it's not clear if they were purchased. By the time the film got produced, the original had fallen into obscurity and Empire Pictures had gone bankrupt. The film was reworked to remove the weapon's alien origins, making it a creation of the U.S. military. The end result, Deadly Weapon (1989), was written and directed by Michael Miner, co-creator and writer of the original RoboCop (1987). Band also produced another loose remake, Alien Arsenal, in the 1990s for his Action Xtreme sub-label.",

What the characters describe in the movie is exactly what it was: a backup engine made for the Apollo missions which was was never actually used. Its purpose was to be the last engine that gets the actual capsule to the moon and back. A lot of the NASA [equipment] was built in Los Angeles back in the day, so there's still a lot of rocket refuse left over in warehouses in the Valley. Through the years, I've befriended a man named Carlos [Guzman], who runs a place up in the Valley called Norton Sales [\"the only prop house in America specializing in vintage aerospace and industrial props from the atomic and space age\"] and I've worked with him on a few short films. He has this massive warehouse that's packed with dusty old space crap and I always feel like a kid in a candy store when I visit [laughs]. Carlos knows everything that's stored in there, what it's used for and why. I'll often just go to poke around and have fun.\nOne of Carlos's all-star pieces is this rocket engine that I asked to use. We talked it through and I was able to [use it]. I ended up buying a box truck here in Los Angeles, packed it with a bunch of rocket stuff from Carlos's warehouse, then drove it across the country to upstate New York by myself where we shot the film. A few months later, I drove all the stuff back in the box truck, dropped it off to Carlos, then sold the truck for about a thousand dollars more than I had originally paid for it. As this was an indie movie, that was the kind of thing that all of our cast and crew were doing. We were trying the best we could to make the film appear as realistic as possible, but in a way that wouldn't require us to buy everything outright. We were begging and borrowing and stealing to make the film happen.\"",

Only the Stadium and the Chancellorship were actually built, but the later was wrecked by bombings and finally looted and demolished by the Red Army. The rest of them were never built, and constructions like the Arch and the Dome were so massive, that architects were unsure of their viability, until recent computer-based simulation have stated that Speer's calculations were correct, and had Hitler won the war, Berlin would have pretty much looked as the movie shows. Interestingly, the movie also portrays Berlin as bleak and gray. In the book, March describes the city looking like this from the never ending construction projects.",

The main problem I had was that, overall, the anthology was just a bit...dull. Well-made shorts, for the most part, but I found myself taking multiple breaks while watching because, in toto, it just wasn't holding my attention. A couple got my attention for negative reasons -- despite knowing the basic premise of the anthology, I could figure out what they were trying to convey, or even what was happening. One, \"DTF,\" stood out because it was amusing, if a bit predictable. Overall, though, most of them just kinda happened and I just kinda happened to watch, and I finished it with the feeling that I hadn't wasted my time but I also hadn't really felt like it was worth the time either.A couple extra notes. One, I'm a straight male Gen Xer, so that obviously had an impact on my viewing and my review. Two, if you're one of those men who feel like men are being oppressed for some reason, you'll probably just be angry and resentful watching a few of the shorts. Personally I think you should just get over it, accept that the world doesn't revolve around you, and watch this movie with an open mind. But if that's not possible, you should probably skip this movie and watch something that won't upset you. Why upset yourself unnecessarily?",

There is not a single object with Cyrillic letters, but there are plenty with English ones. Many items are Western consumer goods which were rare in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Particular examples are beer cans and a bottle of Jagermeister on a desk. The weapons the soldiers wield are also not even resembling Soviet rifles which would've been familiar to all viewers who completed their military services. They look more like a strange \"crossbreed\" of American M-16 and M-1 rifles. The vehicle the soldiers are using is a MAZ missile trailer truck, but the same vehicle was also built for the civilian market and sold to many countries. The helicopter that shows up in one of the scenes is a Kamov Ka-26 which was never used by the Soviet military (and in fact only one Warsaw Pact country did, Hungary). The hovercraft that is seen turning and leaving is also not a (known) military vehicle, but anyone in the 1980s should've associated the image with the air-cushion ferries on the English Channel which were a famous and novel technical achievement at the time.",

In a race against time, it remains unclear who will survive the next 24 hours...Horror in the eternal ice...I wasn't sure if I should really subject myself to this. A kind of rip-off of Carpenter's The Thing but without gore... (?) Doesn't sound particularly tempting. And at just under 2 hours, it's not a short \"pleasure\" either. On the other hand, I love snow/ice scenarios and the title promised me at least some red splashes on the white background.Unfortunately, a good setting does not make a good film. Of course, a dark, claustrophobic research station comes across as atmospheric. The fact that we are stuck there with danger and cannot escape because everything that could save us is several days away actually works well. The necessary ingredients for a tasteful contribution are basically there. Unfortunately, Blood and Snow never grabs us by the balls, or anywhere else, to give us a good shake. Instead, sadness and boredom slowly set in. We sense the danger, experience the paranoia, but unfortunately it is only gripping in the rarest of cases.Dialogue-heavy low-budget thriller that nevertheless comes across as (frighteningly) meaningless for long stretches.",

Toho commissioned the story, wanting to appeal to a female audiences since Toho president/producer Iwao Mori found that women made up a large portion of the movie-going public and would often bring people along with them. Writers Takehiko Fukunaga, Shin'ichirô Nakamura, and Yoshie Hotta each wrote part of the original story which was then adapted by screenwriter Shin'ichi Sekizawa into the final film. The film was a hit at the box office and became one of Toho's most successful fantasy films, with Mothra becoming a popular character who would star alongside Godzilla as well has her own film series decades later.",

            "storyline": "In my view, \"M,\" a Sci-Fi drama directed by Vardan Tozija, emerges as a poignant critique of capitalism and a powerful pro-refugee statement. This film, set in a dystopian near-future, intricately weaves a narrative that challenges the viewers to reflect on the consequences of socio-economic systems that marginalize the vulnerable and fuel societal decay.The story revolves around Marko, a young boy with a vivid imagination, and his grief-stricken, paranoid father, living in isolation within a distant, decaying forest. The father-son relationship is strained and marked by solitude, reflecting the broader societal disintegration around them. Marko's innocent spirit and courageous persistence stand in stark contrast to the harsh realities imposed by a world driven by capitalist excess and neglect.One of the film's strengths is its use of magical realism to juxtapose Marko's fantasy world with the grim reality he inhabits. The narrative deftly shifts between Marko's imaginative escapades and the brutal truth of his environment, symbolizing the thin veil between hope and despair. The friendship between Marko and Miko, a boy with Down syndrome, further underscores the theme of pure-hearted resilience against systemic oppression. This relationship is a testament to the director's belief in sincerity and unconditional love as powerful forces against societal injustice.\"M\" is not just a film about individual struggle; it is a broader commentary on the repercussions of capitalism and the dehumanization it fosters. The metaphor of a virus, representing the rage and humiliation of society's outcasts, eloquently captures the director's fear of a world where unchecked capitalism leads to a breakdown of social cohesion and a regression to primal survival instincts. This metaphor resonates deeply with current global issues, particularly the plight of refugees and stateless individuals who are often the casualties of economic and political systems designed to exclude them.The visual and auditory elements of \"M\" enhance its narrative impact. The use of narrow, telephoto lenses and the interplay of light and shadows create a dreamlike quality that underscores the film's magical realism. The restrained camera movements and minimalistic score, featuring soft piano and string tones, allow the viewer to immerse in the emotional depths of Marko's journey.In a landscape where Balkan cinema often adheres to hyper-realistic social dramas, \"M\" stands out by venturing into the realms of science fiction and fantasy. This choice not only broadens the film's appeal but also challenges the conventional boundaries of regional cinema. The dystopian setting, characterized by post-transitional decay, serves as an almost too-real backdrop that amplifies the film's critique of capitalism and its call for empathy and systemic change.Ultimately, \"M\" is a visually stunning and emotionally compelling film that urges viewers to reflect on the world we are creating. It is a clarion call for compassion, highlighting the urgent need to address the systemic issues that drive individuals to the margins of society. Through Marko's quest for meaning and the film's broader societal critique, \"M\" reinforces the director's belief that films should inspire us to make the world a better place, even if the task seems delusional at times.",

He was hesitant with the famous monster talk scene but was unable to dispute the studio mandates from Toho. Nevertheless, Honda was troubled by the direction Toho was forcing the series to take, mentioning, \"I am concerned that we are drifting toward taking the easy route, believing a silly story line is OK, though it might be mocked by adults simply because the film is made for children. Kids will not tolerate nonsense.\" Tanaka would come to regret his decision, which he described as a mistake.",

The movie's cover alone was more than sufficient for me to take an interest in the movie.Sure, I had never even heard about the movie, so writers Boris C. Q. and Matías Xavier Rispau had every possible opportunity to entertain, impress and bedazzle me with this movie. And I must admit, that even without knowing anything about the movie, I had some expectations to it from the impressive cover alone.The narrative in \"Me Encontrarás En Lo Profundo Del Abismo\" is very slow paced, especially since you are mostly just following Bannon (played by Martín Rispau) around, as he scavenge through the rubble and ruins of the city where it is perpetually dark and raining. I have to admit that about halfway through the 104 minute runtime then I had almost given up twice on continue watching the movie, because the narrative was so unfathomably slow paced.Needless to say that I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list, given my very limited exposure to the Argentinean cinema. It is a pretty small cast ensemble throughout the entire movie, luckily then the acting performances were good, so the actors and actresses carried the movie well enough.There were a few special effects throughout the course of the movie. But they definitely worked well in favor of the overall enjoyment of the movie. The large creature walking outside had an odd Lovecraftian feel to it, while the man-sized creature inside the building had a mixture of a Xenomorph and the creature from the \"Feast\" movies feel to it.The cinematography is good in the movie, and it definitely feels like the audience is right there alongside Bannon in the rubble, as he struggles with staying hidden and avoiding strange creatures.Ultimately, \"Me Encontrarás En Lo Profundo Del Abismo\" was cut short by the incredibly slow narrative, because it was quite a struggle to keep having an interest in the storyline when nothing overly interesting happened.My rating of director Matías Xavier Rispau's 2022 movie \"Me Encontrarás En Lo Profundo Del Abismo\" lands on a four out of ten stars. This was a rather disappointing viewing experience, and the movie's cover far over-sold the movie by a landslide.",

The boss mentioned about the Russians, trying to beat Americans and there was no follow up on that part of the story.

Its American distributors, Cinema Shares International, built up a large advertising campaign around the movie, and a drastically shortened version that cut the film down to around 40 minutes premiered on prime-time TV on the NBC network. The film's VHS releases were also mistakenly believed to be in public domain, which made it more easily accessible and adding to the movie's notoriety in the US. Despite the film being disliked by the majority of fans, the movie actually received positive reviews from critics upon its initial release in the States. Vincent Canby praised Godzilla's development stating that \"the dragon has become St. George\" and wrote that the film \"demonstrates the rewards of friendships, between humans as well as monsters, and it is gentle.\" Variety also praised the special effects work and the miniatures work as superb and \"reflecting a creative understanding of the camera\". The English film critic Phil Hardy also lauded the film's visuals as expertly done.",

Films from rival studios would should monsters frequently bleeding, while popular Japanese superhero TV shows had the superheroes routinely slice, decapitate, and overall mutilate their monster opponents. However, special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya felt that such violence was inappropriate to show on the big screen and when Toho wanted Gorosaurus to bleed profusely after King Kong tore his jaws apart, Tsuburaya snapped back, saying \"These movies are for kids. Why do you enjoy showing them blood?\" The compromise was for Gorosaurus to foam at the mouth instead.",

However, it was successful enough that it was decided to continue the series, albeit as part of a film campaign called the Toho Champion Festival, a seasonal matinee that specifically targeted children. This meant that subsequent films would have to reduced their budgets and staff since the Godzilla films were just too expensive to continue making in their original manner. For example, this film and the ones prior had two or more large groups of crew members that divided the work on the character drama and special effects sequences. Case in point: cinematographer Taiichi Kankura shot the live action character drama directed by Ishirô Honda, while different cinematographers, Yôichi Manoda and Sokei Tomioka, shot the monster sequences directed by Sadamasa Arikawa. Subsequent films reduced this to a singular crew that had to manage all of those aspects at once.",

Overall, it was a suspenseful and interesting story, with beautiful shots of Moroccan deserts and rural life. Through this story of a young, pregnant woman separated from her upper class family, the director hints at deeper questions:\nIs religion a luxury most can't afford?What is our connection to the unseen world, even for those that don't really believe in it?",

            "storyline": "Moral dilemmas often call for making hard choices, matters necessitating profound, introspective soul-searching. And, as this insightful sci-fi offering illustrates, it's a process that not only includes us mortals, but also extends to supernatural beings possessing tremendous powers and even greater responsibilities. When the Earth's existence is threatened by the sudden appearance of an enormous, mysterious, seemingly menacing planet in the sky above, a mild-mannered professor and family man (Dominic Bogart) who carries a secret about his true nature must decide whether to continue living out the life he so dearly enjoys or live up to an ancient obligation as a protector of the world. Can he make the right choice between quiet domestic contentment with his wife (Piercey Dalton) and son (Elijah Maximus), or must he inevitably bring himself to sacrifice this tranquil life in order to fulfill his sacred responsibility of keeping his promise to save a questionably deserving planet, one that has repeatedly failed through the ages to attain the stability and social maturity hoped for it by its guardian shepherds? Such is the heady question presented in writer-director Eric Esau's morality play set in a world of extraordinary circumstances. The filmmaker's third feature outing provides viewers with a look into a scenario where much is on the line for both the planet and for one of the individuals sworn to save it, along with the personal reflection he must undergo in deciding which choice to make. While the film could occasionally use some quickened pacing in the first half, it nevertheless delivers on its central premise with ample heartfelt emotion, a quality rarely seen in sci-fi offerings to the degree that it's on display here, a trait that truly sets this release apart from other such pictures that rely more heavily on special effects and other glitzy gimmicks to carry the story. It might even bring a tear to one's eye, something almost unheard of for releases in this genre. Admittedly, though, finding this offering may take some effort at the moment, as it has been principally playing the film festival circuit, but it's a movie decidedly deserving of wider attention as a theatrical or streaming release. If you're an ardent fan of movies like this, \"Saturn\" should definitely be on your watchlist.",

According to Banno, they are meant to be Hedorah's eyes, which he considered the most important part of a person's body. The film has a running theme of eyes being injured with several of its characters. However, the reason they do not resemble Hedorah's actual eyes is due to rushed production and a smaller budget. Banno mentioned that not only had Toho given him less than half of the budget of the prior Godzilla films, but he was also only given 35 days to shoot the entire film (both the drama scenes and the special effects scenes). Making matters even more challenging for Banno was the fact that he had to make do with a single film crew.",

(Can't totally blame the writers: the situation in itself is static: \"she went away and she returned at the same age. This is all there is, what we do now?\") There is too much Hallmark and not enough time travel.Some viewers find repulsive (creepy) the idea of a couple with 20 years of age gap. Fine to them, but not for me. For the last 18 years I've been married to a woman 30 years my junior and we have two children. And we are reasonably happy. Either way, the age factor should not weight on the consideration of the merits of the film, which does not take a position on age-different couples. It is just the situation as it is.All in all the movie is just OK, and very little is gained by watching it.",

I dont like all stories and don't see a connection between them all but 4 or 5 of the 6 I really enjoyed, so this bad rating is just not fair and just unfair emotions of people who didn't know what they will get.

This was done to save money, as Corman and his brother Gene Corman often tried to incorporate existing sets, costumes and other elements from previous films into new ones for financial savings. Screenwriter Martin Varno said the Corman brothers were so conscious of their spending that \"'cheap' was the main word in their vocabulary.\" The monster costume scenes in \"Teenage Caveman\" and this film were shot within about two weeks of each other. The costume was modified slightly for this film. Ross Sturlin wore the costume for the scenes in both \"Teenage Caveman\" and this film. Flming was very difficult for Sturlin because it got extremely hot inside the costume during the exterior shots. John John M. Nickolaus Jr. was director of photography for the film, and Jack Bohrer was the production manager. Daniel Haller, who went on to become a film director himself, worked as art director on this film. He did much of the manual construction work on the set himself, and brought a trailer in to the sound stage so he could sleep there and between work sessions. Among the props he built was the rocket-ship, the frame, which was made of plywood that had been cut into circles, then covered with a plastic sheet and spray-painted to look metallic. Haller also created blood cells that the characters looked at under a microscope, and the baby aliens (which resembled seahorses) they looked at under a fluoroscope. Alexander Laszlo composed the music for the film. Almost the entire crew went on to work on Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) with the Corman brothers and Kowalski.",

Pure British English spoken by them was an awesome experience and a pleasure to listen to. Quite challenging to understand, though.I liked the idea of a paleontologist discovering an ancient hibernating entity, and it was quite surprising that this person seemed to be more intelligent than humans, especially while looking and mostly behaving like one.Definitely worth developing and investing some money in this film.

I was more interested in pursuing [Andrei] Tarkovsky [Andrei Tarkovsky]'s kind of way of filmmaking where I was making the film for the subconscious rather the conscious. I thought I'd better do something else, so I made The Dollar Bottom (1981)...That won the Academy Award, so that got me The Sender, and it was with Fox, 20th Century Fox, and then right when we were well into it, almost into production, they turned around and cancelled, and Paramount Pictures picked it up in three days, and we went straight ahead. But it's one of these films, I found out, as I said, Paramount were completely not interested in it, they really did nothing with it at the time, which was a shame... it was a very, very good script, and I got a really good cast of actors to do it, and it was a baptism by fire for me, with the producer and the studios and everything...''.",

Two doctors relate his problem to an Asian philosophy that states that mental defects are transmitted from generation to generation. He learns that one of his distant ancestors murdered his wife as a way of demonstrating a point to his lord about the importance of love over the emptiness of lust and to drive home the point further, created a series of illustrations of the dead woman decaying which in turn trigger the memories of his distant descendant. But is the whole thing merely a game concocted by the two doctors, who may even have driven themselves mad in the process? The first half of the film is stunning. It relates an experience to a character who doesn't remember/know it. We're given mystery that haunts and unanswered questions, mentions to \"the incident\" and \"the man who gave you the scroll\", and the movie toys with \"how much of this is real and how much of it made up or imagined or hallucinated?\" questions. That the protagonist is an amnesiac who therefore can neither confirm nor deny anything makes us a carte blanche on which Toshio Matsumoto writes a mystery then constantly rewrites it, he goes back and erases details or changes them or adds new ones. Dr. Masaki died a month ago but then he shows up and we're told it was all a clever ploy of his rival doctor, Dr. Wakabayashi. Then Dr. Wakabayashi disappears and Dr. Masaki tells us that he's the fiend, the bad guy, the man behind the curtain.But the movie can be very talky when it showed us it can also be visually amazing, and there's a lot of theorizing and psychological mumbo jumbo that go nowhere because none of it helps the Dogura Magura that is about an insane young man viewing the world as though on a fractured mirror. A big part of the movie is like a game we're invited to observe without knowing the rules or like a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are given to us one at a time. As such, the mystery is not for us to solve but rather watch it play out. To the extent that a mentally unstable protagonist who can't remember his past finds himself a pawn in the hands of his doctors the movie reminds me of a Shutter Island that is not a pastiche of 50's potboilers.But it's also a movie made by one of the most fiercely creative voices in Japanese cinema. Toshio Matsumoto made only three feature films but all of them are very different to each other and original in their own ways. In the end, the movie explodes into a frenzy of fiery red colors and papers swirling in the air and we get a Dadaist image of a clock broken then glued together askew and the protagonist crosses over to a bloody twilight zone where he sees/hallucinates himself, or his doppelganger, surrounded by dead bodies. Then we're back in the same room we were in the start and the boy wakes up again and how much of what we saw was a dream or the delirium of an insane mind that may be even partially real or the broken pieces of memory glued together askew it's impossible to tell.",

This is often misunderstood to be an error but it's actually an intentional choice, inspired by the Italian documentary A Dog's Life (1962), which showcased the decomposed remains of a turtle that swayed in the wind. Many fans however took it further, pointing out that it appeared to blink suggesting it was indeed a living, albeit disfigured, creature. The creature eventually was nicknamed \"Skeleturtle\" and developed a cult following. It would make a cameo in a Godzilla comic and Toho themselves would sell merchandise of the creature, cementing its status as an actual kaiju with it's official name being translated to \"Mystery Bones of Infant Island\".",

Equally important was their ability to see each other, as well as the need to establish fixed eyelines to each of the elements on their screen, without which the reality of the movie would have been destroyed. In order to achieve this, each set had a fixed camera integrated into a visual communication system that we created using Interrotrons (essentially, two-way teleprompters) connected to a live switching system. This allowed not only me, but each actor looking at their teleprompter to see a previsualization of the finished scene -- that included not only the live feed of the cameras in the other rooms, but also the computer interface as they typed and interacted with it.\"",

And I needed absolutely no persuasion to sit down and watch it, as this was apparently some sort of zombie movie that I had never heard about, much less seen before. And since I am a sucker for all things zombie, of course I would check out what director Hank Braxtan had to offer.Writers Hank Braxtan, Steve Hillard, Guy J. Jackson and Dennis Nowlan put together an interesting enough take on the zombie genre. It definitely was a one of a kind take on the zombie genre, I will say that much. But that doesn't necessarily mean it was a great movie. Sure, \"Glowzies\" was watchable and entertaining enough for what it was, but it was hardly a movie that left a lasting impression, much less a movie I will ever return to watch a second time.The acting performances in the movie were good, and had some familiar faces on the screen, with the likes of James Remar and Michael Dorn.\"Glowzies\" actually had surprisingly good special effects. Sure, it wasn't impressive effects that will leave you slack-jawed, but for a movie such as it was, the effects definitely were good.If you enjoy zombie movies, give \"Glowzies\" a chance. It actually is different enough from the mainstream zombie genre to make it worth checking out.My rating of director Hank Braxtan's 2023 movie \"Glowzies\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

Though J. Z. Knight appears early and often as an interviewed expert in the movie, it is not until the end that she is identified as the founder of RSE, and her most controversial aspects (among which are her claim to be able to \"channel\" a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit named Ramtha) are not included at all. Many sources (for example, John Gorenfeld's September 2004 Salon article and Alison Willmore's October 2020 New York magazine article) state that this movie's three directors, William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente, were at the time also followers of Knight and RSE. Mark Vicente later became involved with another prominent cult: NXIVM, the human-potential-development and sex-trafficking pyramid scheme founded by convicted con artist Keith Raniere. After leaving NXIVM, Vicente participated in the exposé documentary series The Vow, revealing many of the cult's damaging tactics; however, nowhere in The Vow does Vicente admit that NXIVM was not his first time adhering to a cult-like group.",

The monsters unleashed in town mirror the loss in Aubrey's life. Her reaction to them follows the 5 stages of grief. First, she ignores everything and goes through denial (\"I wonder if the world still exists if I choose to ignore it\"). This abruptly switches to anger (punching the wall until her hand is bloody), then bargaining (\"okay Grace, you get one chance...we'll try it your way\"), followed by depression (the despondent conversation in the library where she says she's incapable of happiness), and culminating in acceptance (finally seeing Edward's face in her visions; symbolically drowning the man she cheated with; writing out the \"Forgive + Forget\" message; letting go and floating upwards).",

Yet, I still opted to sit down and watch the movie, given it was a natural disaster movie that I hadn't already seen.Writer Marc Gottlieb put together a script and storyline that was very, very generic and predictable for a natural disaster movie. And trust me when I say that there are far better natural disaster movies with subzero temperatures out there. And there really is no particular reason to sit down and spend 85 minutes on watching \"Ice Storm\". So many things throughout the course of the bland narrative just makes you shake your head in disbelief.The cast ensemble in the movie was relatively unfamiliar to me, which is usually something I enjoy in movies. However, the script in \"Ice Storm\" was every bit as frozen and rigid as the natural disaster was supposed to be, so the actors and actresses virtually had nothing to work with, and it showed on the screen. I was only familiar with William Baldwin.Visually then you're not in for anything great here. But on the upside, then the effects weren't as bad as you might expect from a movie from the dreaded The Asylum movie company. However, nor was it among their best of work. It was, for a lack of better words, mediocre and bland.\"Ice Storm\" was a struggle to sit through, and your eyes will probably freeze solid from boredom long before you get through the 85 minutes it runs for.My rating of director Jared Cohn's 2023 movie \"Ice Storm\" lands on a generous two out of ten stars. Quite amazing that such laughable movies get made still.",

Bomb squads and emergency personnel were deployed. The two men who installed the devices were arrested and charged with several counts of placing a hoax device to incite panic, a felony. Turner Broadcasting, Cartoon Network's parent company, and Interference, Inc., the marketing company that created the campaign, reached a settlement with city and state officials to resolve any civil or criminal claims. The companies agreed to pay $1 million to the Boston police department, and $1 million to Homeland Security. Jim Samples, head of Cartoon Network, resigned.

David Hume in his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions: \"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Whence then is evil?\"",

Even more luck is that we do not have to wait half way through the movie to see icy action.They follow the formula perfectly so we can guess what happens accurately. The fun is in seeing that they do it correctly not logically. We get lots of stay in the car scenes. (I know you are not supposed to stay in the car in a tornado movie.) One of the highlights of the movie is cell phones that no longer get service and other cell phones that stop working when the lights go out.I cannot believe they gave up eating spaghetti for a romp in a hot tub! Which reminds me one day you need to watch \"Eating Raoul\" (1982).At least this movie should put a little spike in your life. Some people may think this movie sucks.

The monster in Ape Vs Monster is the Gila monster that the Ape defeated. The Asylum is no stranger to Schlock like this.

That plus the title made me think a lot of this film would be the main character visiting an old, decrepit museum that's who knows how old, but that isn't a big part of the movie.I guess what the film's going for is still fairly engaging, but definitely not as intriguing. It mostly revolves around the main character being torn between the two factions that this dystopian society has been divided into, and that can be an interesting conflict for sure.The film has plenty to say about then state of the world, how people treat each other, religious beliefs, and what could happen after a world-ending disaster. It's got an oppressively bleak atmosphere and there's usually something interesting to look at or think about, but it is quite slow-moving in parts.I'm a little disappointed it's not what I expected, but also having that expectation is on me in the end. I think this is still pretty good for what it is, even if it's more about post-apocalyptic societal division than a strange Russian museum tour. At least there's always Russian Ark for the latter.",

Similar to Silly Putty, in that it could bounce like a ball and make comic imprints, the mixture was a combination of rubber, mineral oil, and green food coloring that had been lab-tested with no ill effects and was marketed as being made of \"a new parent-approved material that is non-toxic and will not stain.\" Within weeks, claims came pouring in to both Hasbro and Disney that the toy Flubber was causing full-body rashes and sore throats in many of the children who used it, resulting in several lawsuits by angry parents. Eventually, after much experimentation, and an intensive investigation by the FDA, it was determined that there was a property in the mixture, of unknown origin, that caused an infection of the hair follicles in certain individuals. The product was recalled, but disposing of it turned out to be an even dicier proposition. Trying to incinerate the mixture only produced a heavy, dense black cloud around the Providence, Rhode Island, garbage dump where the attempt was made. Working with the U.S. Coast Guard to sink the substance at sea turned out to be a fiasco, as well, as the next day almost all of the dumped Flubber came floating back into Narragansett Bay. Finally, it was decided to use the mixture as landfill, buried deep under the parking lot at Hasbro's new warehouse, just outside of Providence. Even then, the incredible but true story doesn't end there. A popular \"urban legend\" among Hasbro employees is that every year, during the hottest days of summer, you can still spot some of the mixture oozing through the cracks in the parking lot.",

Although the play was praised by critics and audiences, it wasn't well promoted and found itself in direct competition with ABC's unexpected hit Batman (1966), which had just begun airing on TV twice a week. As a matter of fact, Superman's debut was intended to be heralded on the cover of Life Magazine, but it was ultimately reduced to a small sidebar in a flashy cover story about Batman. This heavily reworked TV special was an attempt to recoup some of the show's financial losses and to boost interest in licensing it for high school and regional theatre productions, but ABC buried it on their late-night schedule for both broadcasts.",

This born-different young man tries to escape and rebel at the beginning, turns to be \"different and proud\" at the end. A true hero is born when Ma Shan bravely leads the third team to complete the final mission. It's very burning and empathic. The Chinese-style \"father-son love\" between Ma Shan and Cao Guouncle is also very delicate and moving.I have learned how hard the production and post production of this film is. I admire Director Lu Chuan's exploration and persistence in science fiction film production standards and international collaborations. I am willing to offer my support to every director who explores new technologies and new directions, and look forward to more excellent works by Director Lu Chuan.",

It's almost funny. As a matter of fact, the better my acting was in some of the later scenes, the funnier film was. I found myself at the mercy of people who didn't know what they were doing. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but my feeling is, the producers destroyed it. Tobe could have made three different movies with material he had, and each one would have worked. But by the time he got it, it had changed from a love story to a suspense thriller about my character's paranoid fantasy, to a \"guy goes crazy\" film about this insane killer who becomes a destructive force that's going to wipe out mankind. We went back and kind of restructured it as a love story, but it didn't really help.

Even more so, for those who have an issue with it: there is a lot of homoerotic intercourse and other stuff happening. I'm not a particular fan of any of that, but I understand what the movie is trying to do.The theme itself is interesting and intriguing - but the movie is not really exploring ... well it seems quite focused on the sex. No pun intended - with bodily fluids, not just semen is meant. Women squirt liquid too and then there is the ... well I can't describe it other than just write it: Pee.This may all sound disgusting to you and that is more than fair. Cumming on people (sometimes on their faces) is not meant to be enticing either - though I guess it is seen as waste. Not sure if the movie is trying to make a connection about that and some religious thing about self pleasure and the \"waste\" of sperm ... it didn't feel like it was making a point in that direction but maybe I missed it.Anyway the theme is decent - the way it is made, this won't win many viewers over I assume ... this is meant to shock the viewers .. although even in that it may fail since many may be used to movies trying to shock them ... up to you (no pun intended) - not that this will make a social statement that I am aware of.",

Strangestuff goes there once again, and they somehow manage to splice that overused concept with dashes of Revenge of the Nerds, Star Trek, and the Blob.

That is a seriously ambitious goal for a low-budget indie with a small ensemble cast and a limited set--almost a stage play, really--and, in the opinion of this reviewer, it's a swing and a miss. Instead of using the \"stop time\" gimmick to advance the story, it is simply used to refresh the story whenever it goes over the top. Which it does a lot. It is the same difference between, for example, teaching someone to use a gun, or simply picking up a gun and shooting your student. Both teach you about guns. But in completely different ways.

The money received from the product placement funded the entire production as well as the purchase of land where you can hike in the mountains and look for bird's nests. Santiago used his position in the company to extend similar offers to several filmmakers, including Larry Flash Jenkins for his directorial debut Don't Touch If You Ain't Prayed (2005).

Her ability to convey a wide range of emotions with subtlety and strength adds a layer of intensity to the film that resonates long after the credits roll.A surprising standout is Blake Lobo, the dog who plays a pivotal role alongside Reyes. His presence adds warmth and companionship in an otherwise desolate world, serving as both a protector and a symbol of hope.Quijada's film is a haunting exploration of isolation, but it's the emotional connections between Reyes and Blake Lobo that truly elevate it, making Tomorrow Before After a memorable and moving experience.",

And unfortunately, that bad acting will make this movie very difficult to get through. And because I was so enthralled with the plot, I kept waiting for the acting to get better, But unfortunately, It never did. Now don't get me wrong, I can appreciate independent movies, that are not mass produced at the Hollywood factories. However, an exciting premise, is absolutely ruined by the acting in this movie. This is the first movie review I've ever done, and since I paid $1.99 for this movie and was so upset after viewing this movie about that $1.99, I felt compelled to warn others to avoid this one like the plague.",

The only thing that stands in her way is an all female rock group (Julie K. Smith, Regina Russell, Sasha Peralta, Linda Vox) with huge libidos and finding out which one of them is the fabled \"sexual nexus\" she needs to destroy the planet.I'll give it points for being unique, putting in a few bucks for the alien concept and only 70 minutes long. However much of it isn't very good. Shot in an off the cuff fashion that sees the T&A thrown at you casually. The women liking to get topless on their own or with the help of the alien's powers. The acting is sufficient, but the comedy isn't funny in the least.For a group called \"Top Heavy\" favorite lady Julie K. Smith is the bustiest by a wide margin. Seeing her assets pressed up against glass stood out as a visual, but I liked her cornrow hairstyle too. Julie Strain has a small nude role - almost a cameo - and as the sexual tyrant alien, O'Brien supplies a quick dose. 'Baberellas' asks you to put up with a lot and boobs can only salvage so much.",

And it is his first, University time, movie which attracted attention right away, especially in the country of dying social realism. Firstly, it is a story of a real medical surgery operation on separating the Siamese twins Masha and Sasha. (Later they would live long enough to learn they are nobodies, to become alcoholic's and die). secondly, a girl is quoting some lines from Tomas Mann \"The Magic Mountain\" with description of the gore scenes of Wolrd War I. Then there is some info about horrific efforts to produce a super man in Soviet Russia. All those plots may make you really disturbed and puzzled. You are sure it is a talented job deserved to be awarded. But... what did the director wanted to say by his work? He is in a cozy position: like, this is, folks, what I tell you and, well, you...ah... watch it and... I don't know what. Later Mr. E made another interesting (not documentary) movie called \"Scientific Section of Pilots\" (Nauchnaya sektsiya pilotov (1996) here in IMDb.COM) about strange, fake and real, dead bodies in Moscow metro (which is funny too, for we are ready to see something like this in American movies, and, thank God, not here in Moscow) with a slogan like \"7 millions go underground and some never get out!\" Now he has done a TV-series about mysterious places (like abandoned KGB bunkers) located in all over Russia. So Mr. E seems to have only one track: mystification. So when you are in the right mood, you may watch it but it is just Russia movie past, as it is already outmoded now.",

He told Draculina magazine that Ellen Cabot was an old girlfriend from high school who he had a real bad break up with his senior year. He said she was a screaming bitch. So whenever DeCoteau made what he feels is a very bad movie, he used her name instead of his in the credits. However, he later retracted this by claiming that he merely made the pseudonym up to cover up his homosexuality.",

Then, not just the government gets involved, but the church--its great.Once the basics, the experiment, are accomplished, what is are the grander goals--how much sex gives how much power?  What are the parameters for goals, what can be done with it?  The government licks its chops.  The churchman asks, don't we need love as well as sex?  What are the role of gang bangs, perversions, whatever?  OK, the latter two are just thoughts not action, and that is good--just part of the wit.  A lot of that is present here.  There are mainly one stud and two gorgeous leading ladies, but the professor also discovers his wife is cheating on him.  Great fun and lighthearted--you'll enjoy it.",

            "storyline": "I went into Burst City not knowing what it was. I hadn't seen footage or read much about it, and I hadn't seen any of Sogo Ishii's other films, to get a sense of the director. But from a glance at some of the director's filmography, posters and screenshots I may have seen out in the ether, I could tell there was a punk aesthetic in some of his films, that I personally found immensely intriguing, and there's a few of his films that I know by name and by poster art if nothing else and have long desired to see. I guess the reason I went this long without watching any of his films, was because I couldn't find any of them in any kind of half-decent quality.Burst City it turns out, is some kind of insane 1980s Japanese punk rock concept album music video. Like \"Tommy\", but with ridiculous teenage Japanese punk songs with lyrics that make no sense, directed by way of a young Shin'ya Tsukamoto. What skeleton of a plot there is, you might sometimes sense occasionally, like an underdeveloped V-cinema Takashi Miike dystopian Mad Max sci-fi script, bobbing just below the surface, drowning under the enormity of the film's aesthetic. Basically, the story of the film, or the \"concept\" in the sense of the concept album music video, boils down to being about youth rebelling against \"the man\". But when Burst City is at its best is when it blocks out all pretence of a plot and with seeming effortlessness, becomes pure aesthetic perfection.The first scene of Burst City, the first song on the album, which has no lyrics and sets the mood for the album to come, would be, from a directorial perspective, a masterfully brilliant opening to any film with a genuine narrative script that might be able to accommodate such an opening. Many of the other scenes in Burst City, too, feel like they could make really heart-pumping moments in a more conventional film. But the fact is that they're all together in this one nonsensical film, which may make the whole thing feel somewhat hollow in the end - like there's no substance here - OR it could be seen as freeing the film up from slavish adherence to a narrative that would diminish its aesthetic credibility.The best comparison for Burst City would be another 80s cult Japanese musical film that was curated out of obscurity recently, \"The Legend of the Stardust Brothers\" released on blu-ray by Third Window Films. Another film that's more a full album music video than a narrative feature film, Legend of the Stardust Brothers, like Burst City, is also an extremely campy strange cultural artifact - or time capsule - of a film. I think the main difference is, where Stardust Brothers' camp is just funny, Burst City's camp, while undoubtedly funny, is, to be honest, kind of pretty cool at the same time. Kind of satisfying. How liberating it would be to be a ridiculous Japanese punk in the 80s. I'm kind of really really endeared to this aesthetic.The Arrow blu-ray release, I have no doubt, presents this film looking true to how it was intended, and shown in theatres. Given the limitations of the source material, the blu-ray could frankly have been an upscaled DVD a lot of the time, and I probably wouldn't notice the difference, but I am confident nonetheless that this represents an enormous upgrade over any previous home release this film may have had. This is a hell of a gritty film all shot handheld at night in high-ISO high-noise super-grainy 16mm film, and watching it in any kind of digitally over-compressed, bad transfer, or compromised way, would murky and confuse the aesthetic and greatly diminish the experience, so I think it's fantastic that Arrow is offering this restored version.The allure of discovering Sogo Ishii's punk rock aesthetic on blu-ray persuaded me to blind-buy the Arrow blu-ray when it was announced, but I wasn't in a hurry to watch it, as I had no particular expectation for it. As it turns out, this is the surprise blu-ray release of the year, and the best film I've newly discovered in some time. I hope some of Ishii's other films like Crazy Thunder Road and Electric Dragon 80,000V get similar releases soon.Roger Ebert once said of the 1995 film Fallen Angels by Wong Kar-Wai \"It will appeal to the kinds of people you see in the Japanese animation section of the video store, with their sleeves cut off so you can see their tattoos. And to those who subscribe to more than three film magazines. And to members of garage bands. And to art students.\" Well, none of those examples describes me exactly, but maybe I would fit right in with the types of people Ebert was talking about, because Fallen Angels is one of my most beloved movies. I wonder how he'd describe the hypothetical target audience for this film...",

This is not the case. I could not get through the second scene. The first scene opens up in a bar. The acting was pretty poor, but what really made it bad was the lighting. Apparently shot during the day, but with tungsten lighting above the bar. Blue scenes showing through the large window from behind and orange actors. Anyone knowing what they were doing would not have that happen. That's lazy. Second scene was in a car, at night. Really bad lighting for a car scene. Only light was this strong light coming from the left side of the vehicle. No fill, no moving lights indicating the car was in motion. There are several tricks that can be done to light a car properly to make it seem it's actually moving and see the actors. This was a stationery car with a big light shining in the left windows. Could not finish watching the scene. Have no idea what was going on as the lighting was so bad. Knew immediately that this was not worth wasting my time. No money, at least take the time to light your scenes properly. Just plain lazy.",

            "storyline": "\"Star Abyss\" offers an interesting and darkly imaginative premise set in a future where humans can take interstellar trips through star gates. The film follows a space crew that finds themselves trapped in a terrifying situation when their ship is accidentally caught in the mysterious \"Star Abyss.\" With only four out of 15 passengers able to survive by entering hibernation pods, the stakes are immediately high. Panic quickly ensues, and things take a terrifying turn when an alien monster is unleashed, leading to a tense battle for survival.The premise of being trapped in a deadly, unknown abyss creates an eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere, which keeps viewers on edge throughout. The desperation among the characters, combined with the dangerous manipulation of the alien creature, adds layers of psychological tension to the film.While \"Star Abyss\" offers some genuinely cool fight scenes and moments of intense action, where the characters try to fend off both the alien monster and each other, the real strength lies in the moral dilemmas and survival instincts that emerge during the chaos. These elements keep you invested as alliances shift and betrayals unfold.However, while the film delivers some standout moments of suspense and action, certain character arcs could have been explored more deeply, and the pacing sometimes falters in between key scenes. Despite this, \"Star Abyss\" successfully immerses viewers in its dark, sci-fi world, and fans of space survival films will appreciate the thrill of the story's twists and the gripping fight for survival.If you're a fan of interstellar sci-fi thrillers with a focus on survival, tension, and chaotic space battles, \"Star Abyss\" is worth checking out. It's a thrilling ride that combines cool action sequences with high-stakes human drama.",

It also used an innovative steering mechanism that guided the vehicle, not by the front wheels, but by \"bending\" the middle section with hydraulic rams to effect a turn. The Landmaster's bodywork was made with 3/8-inch steel plating, which helped it tip the scales at over 10 tons. It was so tough, in fact, that it survived a 25-foot jump during testing with no damage. As of today, the original \"Landmaster\" is alive and well, and is currently in the hands of a private collector who purchased it in 2005. It has been restored to its original condition as seen in the film.",

Are we going THERE???\"The scene with the mushroom tea was EPIC, definitely took me by surprise. It was a fantastic diversion from the usual scary movie plots.The local paranormal experts also made the film very believable and gave me the final buy in.I know the other people in the theatre liked it too cause we were all laughing at the same punchlines.The final scene, which I won't give away, was a real surprise, and extremely unexpected. I'm going to watch it again on Thursday because I did get the 10 minutes late and I wana make sure I see the whole thing.If you watch it, make sure to stay for the credits. TONS of laughs in the added scenes there.This has all the hallmarks of a potential cult classic!!!Well done 5'7 films. 👏👏",

It is not the type of movie that general audiences would like because... it's just not obvious. You have to watch it, think about it, feel it, imagine, reimagine, rethink and... it'll still not be clear if you're thinking it right. This is the type of movie that would not be a blockbuster because it's for those who are really into complex plots. Grade: 10 out of 10 for me.",

The story centers around 70-year-old Robyn, who embarks on a transformative journey after taking a formula that reverses aging. Her portrayal is deep and vulnerable, effectively capturing the emotional complexities of reliving life. The film excels in its subtle visual storytelling, focusing more on the human aspect than the science fiction, which enhances its emotional impact. The narrative's exploration of life choices and regrets is both reflective and resonant, encouraging viewers to contemplate their own decisions and life paths.The pacing can be uneven at times, and some plot points feel underdeveloped. While the film ambitiously tackles philosophical themes, these occasionally overshadow the personal story. Despite these flaws, its core message about the beauty of embracing life at every stage makes it a compelling watch. It's a film that not only entertains but also inspires introspection, making it a valuable experience for those who appreciate cinema that challenges and enlightens.",

Outside of the parrallels of a woman confined to a small area for a period of time, this couldn't be further from the aforementioned film and is an entirely different beast. Canadian director Seth Smith previously made the excellent indie horror The Crescent (2017) and this lines up perfectly with that one. The basic plot has a virologist studying a virus that has threatened humanity. As she is on the cusp of a great discovery, she is knocked unconsicious and wakes up in a isolation \"prison\" area. Smith stages things with great effect and the layered storytelling resulted in a great payoff for me. No spoilers for what happens as the story unfolds, but I will say it is a slow one that features one of the more messed up storylines I've seen in a while. And, given COVID, it is definitely timely (and shocking to find out this was all made pre-pandemic).",

AMAZING characters, everyone you can think of from that era. So ya, it was doing a spoof of the classic 50's and 60's movies where basically aliens or monsters attack a small town in the middle of the USA and everyone with different backgrounds has to come together to fight the aliens and save the day (but in this instance its vampire zombies!!!!!When I heard before the festival that it was in black and white I was a bit hesitant because even some of the best horror classics that I love are in color almost always. But once you get about 5-10 minutes in the film you realize that it had to be black and white!Go see this film!",

Throughout the day, Chaney passed a bottle of whiskey to Strange in-between takes.

It is the first film made by director Piotr Szulkin that I have seen. I saw Jerzy Stuhr in the very special \"Sexmission\" (1984) and in \"A Year of the Quiet Sun\" (1984). I saw the beautiful Krystyna Janda in \"Man of Iron\" (1981), \"Mephisto\" (1981), \"The Conductor\" (1980), \"Man of Marble\" (1977). Another well-known name is Leon Niemczyk, probably the most prolific Polish actor of all time (325 films) seen by me in many, the most famous being \"Knife in the Water\" (1962). OK, about the movie now: I'm not going to narrate it like many do. I'll just say that it's worth seeing, even though it's just talk in a closed space, an underground bunker (where, strange situation, after the nuclear war, there is electricity, there are neon lights everywhere). The fact that it is filmed a lot in motion by the talented Witold Sobocinski, mitigates the phenomenon of claustrophobia.",

This article included still shots of Eva from the set, both dressed and fully nude, as well as alongside other women who do appear in the film, so clearly she was attached to the project at one point or another. However, there are currently 3 different versions of this film floating around now-days, none of which has *any* scenes with Eva Ionesco, nor does any of them include her name in the credits. So it is highly plausible that all of her scenes were never intended to actually be included in the final version of the film, but whether the whole thing was just a publicity stunt orchestrated by her mother (one of quite a few in the mid 70's), or what other reasons there may have been is anyone's guess.",

This makes sense, as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a very active area. The neat part in relation to the movie is that while the existence of a \"Ridge\" on the seafloor was known at the time, it was not known that it was so active. It wasn't until the Heezen/Ewing/Tharp mapping of the ocean floor in the 1950s that people discovered that Seismic activity and \"Seafloor Spreading\" due to magma seepage were going on. That was about 20 years after the makers of the film surmised Magma pockets near the Mid-Atlantic.",

One of the better features here is the engaging setup that provides a wholly thrilling setup that allows for the various setpieces to come together nicely. The main setup of the island's presence was discovered back during WWII where the true nature of it's healing flora were first discovered by the presence of the snake there keeping others from getting there which provides the reasoning for the team to get there trying to recover it. Knowing that the disgraced scientist has to go along on the trip to save his daughter which makes the trip feel far more worthwhile to study the fabled species that grows there, it manages to tie together the required elements quite well with a simplistic, straightforward series of ideas to create a fantastic, full-throttle tempo. A fine result of that setup is the series of strong, enjoyable creature action throughout here. Starting off with the attack on the troops during the period-set flashback, the idea of the snake's presence and power gets established early on which helps the film quite well. The present-day sequences, from the group getting ambushed by the killer fish while traveling through the waterway onto the island or the more-traditional jungle-island pratfalls of the depleted group attempting to get their bearings or travel through the unknown dangers of the island all create such a wild and unpredictable atmosphere there's a lot to like before the snake fully appears. Whether taking the ambush approach slithering out of nowhere to tackle and swallow a victim or going for the off-screen approach to keep itself hidden. The second half here of the group wandering through the deadly jungle and trying to make their way to safety at the expense of the vicious creatures present. Content to not just include more scenes of the snake appearing swallowing victims out of nowhere or launching surprise attacks with it being impervious to their firepower, there's also enjoyable scenes with the vicious man-eating plants on the island. This is a fun sequence offering the chance to see the creatures appearing out of the jungle to trap and ensnare victims which is great fun. The cheesiness of the creature attacks once it gets to the snake being featured again gives this one so much fun with it swarming through the jungle after them leading to a creative and fiery finale that all gives this one plenty of positives. There are some slight issues here that bring this one down. The main drawback to the film is more prominent use of jungle-adventure aesthetics than creature feature horror in the first half which might not be all that enjoyable for some. After starting off strong with the initial attack on the soldiers and then meeting the team to get to the island, the slew of confrontations here with the killer fish, the different natural traps left on the island, or the other living creatures there mean that the snake is less of a focus in this part of the film. Regardless of how much this part of the film is, the difference of using this to keep the main creature off-screen might be somewhat disconcerting to see play out. The cheesiness of this one might also be too much to take for some out there, which all hold this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Language.",

When this one works best is the central setup and the potential that lies within this one hoping for something more impactful to emerge. The main idea of the tragedy that sends him out to the secluded lake that houses a series of traumatic incidents to him that allows for the other couple to come find him which signals the start of something happening at the lake the more that goes on there the more the group find themselves subjected to something otherworldly while staying there gives this an intriguing enough mystery to figure out. The series of hallucinations that take place, and the way everything works off of the setpieces created by the creators due to the build-up provided here allows for some fun times here as things spiral out of control in a more over-the-top manner that the finale brings about as this one focuses more on the threat becoming more actualized than implied that had taken place before. Beyond that setup, though, the film struggles with keeping things interesting or thrilling for much of the running time. Way too much focus is made her in trying to get these wholly unlikable and just plain uninteresting people to be the main focus as they're petty problems, overdone traumatic backgrounds, and barely endearing traits that are supposed to make us endearing to them but only manage to produce a feeling of boredom for much of the film. It takes way too long to get going with the film going through the motions of trying to get these troubled people into the area to be affected by the supernatural force there as its build-up to that point is just bland and uninteresting. It doesn't help that so much of this is so easily handicapped from the start where it's easy to see coming which makes the attempts at being mysterious wholly flat with these cliched, uninteresting characters waiting around for the inevitable to happen, all of which hold this one down overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Language.",

Since the Miruthan days, few filmmakers had tried their hands on this genre which doesn't work much. Trip is probably one of the films that try much to be engaging as well as gripping but the poor writing drags down the film. The interesting factor falls down since the starting point and we are confused with the happenings in the film. Yogi Babu and Karunakaran are trying much to save the film with their hilarious performance but unfortunately, the film misuses them. Their comedies are somewhat tiring and don't bring much laughter. The other supporting actors including Sunainaa are left with nothing to perform. They are all struggling to find a place where they can showcase their performance but the film allows only Yogi Babu and Karunakaran to do so. Overall, this is not the right trip to go on.",

One of the changes that was ordered was of the sound of the device that Baron Victor von Frankenstein used to dispose of the body parts that he was using to create his monster. The original grinding sound that the device made while doing so was considered too horrific, so it was replaced with the sound of a flushing toilet, which resulted in unintended laughter from audiences. This was believed for a long time to be the first time ever that the sound of a flushing toilet was heard in a U.S. film. UPDATE: A toilet was also flushed in the film The Grapes of Wrath (1940), which was released 18 years before this one.",

The concept is not surprising, but not very often used.It took some time to figure the back and forth out, but eventually it gives a 'aaahhhh' in recognition.A moderate well B-movie and if you have some time on hand and don't want to think too much in difficult sci-fi terms and twists, it is a nice time filler with a cup of coffee and a coockie.",

It's unlike anything Sion Sono has done before and is the type of film that will have some proclaiming it a masterpiece while others won't like it at all. I can see arguments for both cases but I thought it was a beautifully done piece, visually, and a quiet thoughtful film when considering its implications.Other than one brief scene in color it is entirely in black and white. Early on it put me in mind of Cory McAbee's wonderful space-western/musical THE AMERICAN ASTRONAUT (2001) in that it shares the same approach with a simplistic unconventional design to the spaceship and the way it is seen in the exterior shots as it travels through the lonely cosmos. With THE WHISPERING STAR the interior design has old timey retro gadgetry and commonplace items like a washing machine and a refrigerator full of what looked like cans of beer. In both films these scenes were intentionally styled as oddities and both were effective despite being low budget. But that's where the similarity in the films ends as they become quite different experiences.There is very little dialogue in THE WHISPERING STARS, and it's all done in whispers, lending meaning to the title. The onboard computer is called \"computing device 6-7 MAH Em\" and it talks in the quiet voice of a young child, trying to engage android Yoko Suzuki, a courier in the \"SPACE PARCEL SERVICE,\" in conversations, which are largely ignored by the latter. Even seemingly important decisions on coarse corrections go unresponded to so 6-7 MAH Em just deals with whatever needs to be done while Yoko is more likely to grab a beer from the fridge, study the pile of packages yet to be delivered, or listen to old voice recordings she made. Days pass, even years, with nothing much happening in between the brief stops on planets to deliver packages to humans, all of which has us (and Yoko) wondering at the meaning of the contents of the packages which often seem trivial or unexplainable mysteries at best.Interesting too is that the scenes taking place on the planets were filmed in and around the mostly abandoned city of Fukushima, Japan, where the nuclear power plant catastrophe occurred. Which enhances the feeling of questioning loneliness that Yoko feels as she goes about her deliveries.Very different sort of film for Sono but I liked it and, if anything, I am more impressed by him than ever. There is no telling what he will come up with next but I'll be along for the ride.",

            "storyline": "This is one of Yôjirô Takita's last films in the softcore genre before he went mainstream, a move which eventually led to his winning the US Academy Award in 2009 for the film Departures. Takita started out at Kan Mukai's Shishi Productions, an independent studio which sometimes had its Pink films released through Nikkatsu, and so can be considered both (indie) Pink films and (big studio) Roman Pornos. This film, however, appears to be a true, Nikkatsu-produced Roman Porno, though one of their later, lower-budget efforts, and not up to the quality of the classic Roman Pornos.In spite of the obvious budgetary constraints, this is a delightfully silly little Pink fantasy/comedy, and a good introduction to the genre for the uninitiated. In Kozue Tanaka, Takita has a beautiful model for a star who is capable enough an actress to make her sort-of-double-role believable. Co-star Kaori Sugita is also very pleasant to look at. Lead actor, Yukijirô Hotaru, as the Private Investigator, is more restrained than he is in the similar role in the \"Groper Train\" series.Screenwriter Isao Takagi, who worked with Takita on some of his better-known entries in the \"Groper Train\" series, gives us a story completely lacking in the S&M and misogyny that sometimes gives these films a bad reputation. Instead of shock value, he holds the audience's attention with whimsical flights of pseudo sci-fi fantasy, and enough twists and turns in the plot to cause some surprises, and intentional and amusing confusion. Takita's typically skillful direction, along with some inventive cinematography and set design, the lovely starlets, and interesting sex scenes make this an enjoyable, if minor production in its genre.",

As such, it would have been a perfect match for much of the content presented in the DUST series of sci-fi shorts, for example.However, at almost 2 hrs in length, this was more than just a bit too drawn out.I get it, the director was hoping to get the audience thoroughly engaged with the two primary characters with the exceptionally long \"character study\" dialogue sequences and all that, but the end result was creating more impatience as the seemingly endless (and obvious) dialogue sequences just became evermore predictable, as was the \"surprise\" ending (which became more or less obvious half way through, or even sooner).There is an interesting philosophical punchline, as it were, in the final minute or so of this production, but it seemed like a very long way around the barn to finally get there.If anything, the general theme is faintly reminiscent of the \"Humans\" series, but in that production, there were vastly more interesting and unique characters, evolving scenarios, plots and subplots within subplots that could carry the general concept over multiple episodes, and did so exceedingly well.In this production, it was very much a single stage set theatrical play production, put to film. Not that being \"low budget\" is necessarily a bad thing; many well crafted productions have been remarkably compelling with even less resources to work with.But in this case, less would have definitely been more.Heather Weeks, given what she had to work with, did a fine job delivering her character Evelyn. Taylor (Jack Hadrian) just didn't seem to exactly fit right as the purported artist character. Not faulting the actor here, maybe more of a casting mismatch.In any case, it's not entirely a waste of time to watch this, but neither would I suggest a second viewing.I'll go with five stars . . .",

From Clare's awkward placement in the film to the strange choice of a name like kindar as a stand in for the North Korean regime. A clear result of Hollywood capitulation to the Chinese communist parties rules for foreign cinema.Plot hole after hole and some of the weakest and poorly chosen dialogue I've ever heard. It felt like a rough draft that never got a good proof read and re write.This tragic policy making has to stop!! Make movies better again, make tv better again and stop this diversity quotas. Put the most qualified people in charge of directing, writing and acting. No more forced diversity and no more politics.",

The acting was another really big part that kept the movie from being better than it was. Some of the actors actions were just not really believable and did some very odd things. This was another big factor that kept the flow of the movie from being as smooth as it could. Like I said the storyline was for the most part believable, but their were some holes in the story. Their were a lot of parts where they didn't go into enough detail so you really don't know whats going on. But overall I gave Contagion a rating of 4.",

You would not read 330 pages of a 350 page book and then rave about the book after the last 20 pages? A film is a linear story and it has to engage you along the way otherwise the surprise or whatever the final scenes are, are based on a non enjoyable journey to get there.So it was with Coyote, which did not engage me in any way even for a minute, so I turned it off and consigned it to the 'rubbish' category.",

            "storyline": "I only saw this movie because of the actress. Dai Si has played secondary roles in a few fantasy series, where she often has bad luck in love. Because I felt sorry for her, I looked for a movie where she plays a main character.It turned out to be a very action-oriented SF (science-fiction) movie with visual elements similar to Terminator, Matrix, and Star Wars. Compared to those, it is shorter and has a smaller scope. It is a simple, linear, focused, and limited story that does not contain many plot holes or loose threads. If it fails as a SF story in any way, it would be that it does not leave many open threads for us to build further upon with our imagination (fan-fiction).The fights are relentless, only pausing for the dressing of wounds and planning the next move. Usually I don't like pure action movies, but this is a mercifully short one of only about 90 minutes, so there is no time for neverending car chases or invulnerable guys knocking each other through skyscrapers. Every scene is shorter than it needs to be, and is a step towards the next objective.While many things look familiar, the mere quantity of them and they way they are used has a freshness in itself. The special effects and artificial backgrounds are far from photo-realistic. Still, many objects somehow look physical anyway. I can't determine if there are physical models mixed in, and I don't find it probable, but that is how if feels. I think some of the pretty landscapes are real, at least.Chinese film studios seem to be around 30 years behind when it comes to special effects and story-telling, but considering that the American SF movies from thirty years ago were great, there is no reason to complain. Mutant is a retro movie honoring an outstanding period, bringing a lot of nostalgia.Apart from the graphics, the underlying choreography is amazing. Not in the sense of raw technique, but in terms of meaning and emotions. I am currently rewatching the Star Wars prequels, and I don't think the duel in Mutant is much worse than the duels there. Chinese studios have a lot of experience from martial arts and fantasy productions, so no wonder.When Dai Si (or her stunt woman) at some point is thrown around like a doll, she falls in an unnatural way that looks like hanging from a wire. Not perfect, but at least it shows that it is her real body being thrown across the room, which draws more empathy than a mechanically correct simulation.There is also an unexpected sense of realism in the battles. The soldiers behave somewhat like an actual military, and even take cover sometimes, in contrast to droids and clones in Star Wars.Fight scenes are pointless if we don't care about the characters. In this case, the side of the protagonists are all smart, sincere, sympathetic, and competent. There is no annoying \"funny\" character. Neither is there any bully who would oppress others just to create extra tension. Everyone has good lines and makes reasonable, not stupid, decisions, and noone is invulnerable. For all of this, there is no doubt that their side feels worth rooting for.What stands out is the personality, actions, and character arc of the female lead, who feels fresh and original, and not an exact copy of any character that I know of. The basic idea is not original per se, but the performance and how it plays out is. Even the way she is treated and talked to by the male characters is fresh and not stereotypical.The male hero has a lot of drive and he is even a bit intellectual in that he can make speeches. I think he is quite likable.Honestly, most people would find this movie unwatchable, but at least it is the best Chinese SF movie I have ever seen. Even better than the other one I have seen.",

            "storyline": "Was drawn into seeing 'Black Hollow Cage' with a cool poster/cover, a very intriguing and creative premise and as someone with a general appreciation for horror. That it was low-budget, which from frequent personal experience is rarely a good sign due to that there are so many poor ones out there, made me though apprehensive. 'Black Hollow Cage' is sadly however yet another film seen recently, hence some reiteration because the exact same strengths and flaws those films have are present here, that to me was somewhat disappointing considering its potential which it doesn't do anywhere near enough with. As a film it is actually one of my better and more watchable recent low-budget film viewings though, it's not a great film at all but it is a long way from the mediocre at best and irredeemably awful at worst standard of most recent low-budget viewings, and it could have been so much worse.Lets start with the positives. The scenery is atmospheric and spooky and 'Black Hollow Cage' is surprisingly well shot. The music is suitably moody and adds a good deal to the atmosphere.Found too that the acting was not bad, doing their best with disappointingly nowhere near enough material to work with. Also that there were a few nice twists that intrigued and weren't telegraphed too early.Unfortunately, the story does feel paper thin, disjointed and over-stretched and some of it feels vague, under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less scary. It didn't feel properly resolved or like everything tied up. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them. The less said about that weird talking dog the better. The effects are ropy at best.Dialogue can be stilted and rambling, with lots of clichés and no depth whatsoever (definitely one of the worst assets), while the pace goes to a standstill very quickly and drags with not enough going on worth caring about. Found too many the supposedly shocking moments not surprising or scary and the supposedly creepy atmosphere dreary, due to the excessive obviousness, a lot of dumb and vague moments and explanations and the lack of tension and suspense. There are a good deal of underdeveloped plot elements and often nonsensical character motivations, while too many of the things to make you jump or shocked are far from creative or scary and are pretty tame. It is completely unimaginative and more odd than creepy, with little sense of horror or urgency. Some badly sagging momentum too. The direction is leaden, inexperience seems to be all over the film. There is little creativity or anything shocking, and it seems to try and incorporate more than one tone and it doesn't always feel very focused tonally.Other than the script, the sound and editing are the worst assets. The sound is too echoey and often without warning or reason and makes some of the voices sound strange. The editing is haphazard and affects the coherence of some of the goings on and story structure.In summary, far from great but surprisingly watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

As for the science aspect of this picture, I cannot emphasize its badness enough. WAS there a volcanology consultant involved?

            "storyline": "After the onset of World War III, a group of survivors in a military bunker decides to leave when the food supply has dwindled to the point of restocking, forcing them out to the world where they find it patrolled by man-eating dinosaurs released during the period and must get away from the creatures.This was a decent enough if flawed feature. Among the more likable factors here are from the somewhat enjoyable setup that brings along several fine storyline features wrapped together here. With the beginning of the film showing the descent into the worldwide dystopian future that the rest of the film is supposedly set in and getting the crew of personnel into the military bunker, this immediately gets off to a strong start as the initial immersion into this world is quite fun. On top of that, there's a lot to like here with the means of getting the dinosaurs to be released in the aftermath of the damage as well as the concurrent situations with the various survivors who all have their own issues or problems going on that give the film a serviceable setup. The other really enjoyable part here is the preponderance of cheesy dinosaur attacks and action throughout here. The idea of utilizing the raptors as savage ambush villains in the first half where they attack in the hallways of the military bunker or down in the basement of the facility generates some fun short chase scenes at points. The move into the Rexes and the Pterodactyls in the second half enhance the action considerably with several great sequences including the attack on the car inside the quarry or the final scene in the bunker which is quite fun providing the kind of cheesy entertainment that's required in these kinds of films. It's the biggest part that holds this one up the most. There are some problems to be had here. Among the bigger factors come from the lackluster characters here that, while they go through the motions of setting up the characters and their relationships, runs on a bit too long in a film this short. Rather than spend time with the dinosaurs hunting them down and chasing them, this tends to waste a bit more time than necessary on setting up the storyline involving the pregnant character worried about the fate of her boyfriend while out on the recovery mission or the rather long-winded scenes back at the second survivors' of everyone waiting around for the inevitable without actually trying to barricade anything or prevent the dinos from getting in. This does end up leading to a somewhat bland and dull appearance at points despite the film being so short. The other factor at play here is the generally unappealing and overall expected lackluster CGI effects for the dinosaurs which shouldn't be a surprise but really features a majority of the usual detrimental features. It shouldn't be much of a surprise to learn that they rarely seem to interact with anything in their environment whenever they're on-screen or tend to change size and dimension depending on the camera angle or sequence involved. However, they also manage to showcase the other expected drawbacks in a pixelated appearance and generally unrealistic movements that make it easy to tell they've been faked. It adds a cheap quality to everything that all makes for the issues holding this one back.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence.",

This movie though was so amazingly boring that none of us could keep focused.While chatting with each other I saw only parts of the movie and saw some really interesting camera shots. Also there were really weird, shocking parts and funny parts. The movie is real slow though.For what I saw I would recommend this movie to people who like B-movies, independent and artistic movies. Though even then you should watch it on a dull Sunday or something.For all other people I just wouldn't recommend this movie, because they won't like it.

Xu Dongdong leads the military team trying to overcome the challenges the invaders are throwing their way as well as some personal demons of her own but the price grows increasingly high.I can't point to any one thing that really stands out - the sets are cheap, the CGI goes between barely OK to passable video game level but the story did keep me from switching off. If you've got some time to kill and need a dose of alien invader fu this might be worth checking out. More like a 5 1/2 than 5 stars.",

The use of the enclosed rooms brought a claustrophobic feel to the whole film, with Jumps galore and a great use of CGI. The nod to Alien was observed. The acting was great, the teachers individual characters came through and Director/Writer Jason M J Brown had the suspense from start to finish, with a little bit of X Files thrown in. And maybe a nod to Stranger Things too, the Director obviously loves his Gore and Make Up did a cracking job, he also has an admiration for other Horrors out there and especially the ones which in Space no one can hear you scream. Great fun. Great use of what was available with such a Low Budget. You should go and check it out for yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely recommend to others. Look forward to seeing what else comes from this team of creatives.",

He hinted at a new project ... which sounds amazing to say the least. But let's stick with this one just a bit more.This is quite the tour de force the main character has to go through. And apart from a robot, he is alone most of the time ... will he be able to overcome and stay alive? If he does, for whom will that be? While this was conceited before the war started .. you can see parallels and you can feel the pressure ... sometimes even think: I feel there is a direct connection ... a message the movie is sending us ... in a few words ... like the ones he receives too.The pacing is good and there are a few twists coming to at you ... the effects and the set design also are top notch. We did not talk budget, but I assume he did not have too much money ... and yet it looks amazing ... and the dialog ... just great! A fine line to have him interesting and flawed at the same time ... a \"normal\" human being ... a nobody ... and everything is on him now? Well let's see where he \"leads us\" ... a perfect ending (I would argue, no pun intended)",

It feels somewhat confused about the story it's trying to tell, for the most part it's a sentimental story of family but then randomly throws in moments of tension and violence. The two don't go together smoothly here, and what you end up with is a relatively slow paced drama, set in a harsh world we know little about, with an emotional story which never digs very deep, and some cliched, minimally appearing bad guys.With proper editing, this film should've had at least 30 mins cut out, and add more tense scenes, and trim down the mainly irrelevant long dragged out sappy scenes, and have more of the amazing dramatics we got in the last 10 mins of the film. The flashbacks were also poorly filmed, convoluted and all over the place.The cinematography and score were decent, and the performances spot-on. It's a good attempt, with a failed result. All things considered, this film is not deserving of one's and twos, and clearly not worthy of anything above a seven, so it's a generous 6/10 from me.",

First off the fact that the pups get jets seems unneeded and really only for product placement(Yes I checked they sold toys for this). My second critism is the Antagonist. Okay, so this is the cousin, maybe this could highlight a family dilemma or issue which could show why he does what does. NOPE! He tries to take over the kingdom coz our paw patrol antagonists have absolutely no redeemable elements at all! Coz we here at nickelodeon like to keep it simple! Just make every villain in the factory of overused stereotypes! Give the kids something challenging for once! And that brings me to my final point: The Story. There is never a scene that I found truly deep or interesting. The whole reason kids are interested in this is because, well, its dogs in costumes and with vehicles. But Nickelodeon is just pushing franchises like this for money. Paw patrol in particular makes around 1 Billion dollars a year. I hope there will be a time where Nickelodeon chooses quality over not quantity.",

I also love how the production involved the historic Dahlonega Consolidated Gold mine, a major tourist attraction here in town. I encourage any visitors to go!Overall, I did enjoy this movie. I wouldn't say it was fantastic, but it definitely wasn't boring. It wasn't even overly predictable either. I liked the surprises that came about, and I enjoyed how the movie ended, even if it was kind of quick.The acting was probably the weakest link of the movie, but it was still better than many of the low-budget movies I've seen.I'd give this movie an 8/10 rating, and definitely recommend it if you're looking for a sweet family movie to enjoy over dinner or something.",

S: By the way, it seems to me that this time Shakhnazarov shot a tape aimed at a mass audience.I watched his \"Anna Karenina\" from him and it seems to me that it has already turned out to be less mass-produced, but the film is not bad (\"Anna Karenina\" I'm 7 and also watched in the cinema)\nP. S. S: When the film ended, I even wanted to applaud, but I felt shy and did not do it.Although, the film really deserves them.Shakhnazarov 👏👏👏\nP. S. S.

Most details are seen through Sammy's reverse chronological flashbacks and the final chronological credit montage, although some information comes from brief displays of code seen throughout the film. What follows is an unconfirmed summary of the backstory formed by piecing together these visual clues with the rest of the plot.\nShiotsuki created the initial android AI, code:life. Over time, tensions between robots and humans increased. Human anti-robot organizations were formed, including the Ethics Committee. Shiotsuki's bionic arms suggest that he was injured at some point by one of these groups. At some point, the Ethics Committee attacked Nagi and her robot in the mysterious Tokisaka Incident, causing her severe injury which includes the loss of her arms. Upon seeing what pain his robots (indirectly) caused her, Shiotsuki built her bionic limbs, seen in the final scene as subtle mechanical joints in her hand. Through the process of her rehabilitation, the two grew close. After Nagi fully recovered, she and Shiotsuki decided to do something about human and android relations, seeing how deeply this issue has affected each of them.\nShiotsuki created a café sign which broadcasts the 1138 override protocol. This protocol has higher priority than the suppressive portions of the code:life AI and allows androids to act more freely, including removal of their halos. It also attracts androids to the café sign (\"Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?\").The protocol is spread from robot to robot. Shiotsuki and Nagi set up different cafés in the countryside as safe spaces to allow robots and humans to come together and socialize. However, the cafés were shut down and their patrons destroyed by anti-robot mobs, forcing them to try again at a different location.\nIn response to these failures, Shiotsuki created the code:eve AI in an attempt to allow androids to better express their suppressed emotions and feelings. He argued with Ashimori, and future head of the pro-robot Android Promotion Committee (APC). She wouldn't allow the line between machine and human to be blurred any further, causing Shiotsuki to leave the APC. His parting gift was the first prototype code:eve android, Sammy. Dr. Ashimori is forced to destroy Sammy, but regrets it. The APC repairs Sammy and Dr. Ashimori secretly allows her to live in an APC member's (Rikuo's father) house. Nagi and Shiotsuki moved to the city and set up the current \"Time of Eve\" café. Current APC activity is observational. Setoro, the man in the suit at the café, reports back to Dr. Ashimori.",

Luckily, it's some of the best atmosphere you're likely to find in a movie.Some insane editing, awesome direction, and beautiful cinematography of Japanese cityscapes seal the deal for me. Trippy as hell, with speaking dolphins and odd, 5 minute shots of people diving into pools.Some kind of masterpiece I need to watch a few more times to completely wrap my head around.",

And I have to say that the cover for the 2023 movie \"Escape Pod\" was certainly interesting enough to make me stop and take notice. Now, I had never heard about this movie from writer and director Aaron Mirtes, so I didn't know what I was in for, nor what to expect. So in a way, writer and director Aaron Mirtes had every opportunity to entertain and bedazzle me.The movie has a very small cast ensemble. I was not familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list. But I will say that the acting performances were fair enough. Sure, this was not award-winning performance levels, but the actors and actresses fared well enough with the limitations imposed upon them.The CGI effects in the movie looked like something that you'd see in a 1990s computer game. So yeah, they were not particularly great. And usually sci-fi movies relies on effects in lesser or greater extend to make the narrative and the world in which it takes place believable. And when you see a meteor that looked as atrocious as it did in this movie, it is just a tad difficult to buy into it.However, the practical effects, such as the parasitic infection on the back of Gael looked rather interesting and proved to be quite a contrast to the questionable CGI effects.\"Escape Pod\" is a low budget movie, and it shows. But I will say that I was somewhat impressed with what they managed to pull off here with the limited resources. It shows that the movie was made by people with the right intentions and the hearts in the right place.I was actually positively surprised with this movie. And there was quite a plot twist to the narrative as well, which I certainly hadn't seen coming. So well played, Aaron Mirtes, well played.If you enjoy the sci-fi genre, and don't mind low budget movies, then do give \"Escape Pod\" a chance. I found it to be a watchable and entertaining enough movie.My rating of \"Escape Pod\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

It is not a big budget movie, more the straight to video type that I usually see in redbox, But it includes heartwarming and has a decent message. Perfect for dog-loving kids, it sparks the imagination about what it would be like if you could talk to your pets. The dogs are super adorable as they have to figure out what it is like to be a dog living on earth and the movie is overall just cute and fun.

I've watched the film several times and will probably never get enough. It's a beautifully heartfelt film with outstanding performances from everyone. When I first watched it, I was left with an intense and beautiful feeling about life, friendship, love, and the moment. I thought to myself that each of us has our own \"Isle of Capri song\" moment, one in which we'd like to stay forever, where we feel alive, strong, and happy. And even though it's not possible-or maybe precisely because it's not possible-we should deeply cherish every such moment that comes our way. We should live it, not hesitate, maybe even take risks. That same moment will never return.The creators play with time here-from the perspective of time travel, aging, waiting for love-allowing the viewer to think and feel. Love is beautiful, crazy, patient, painful, and cruel, but above all, eternal. It can endure through time, transcend illness, and heal the soul. It can be the only thing that keeps a person going. All the relationships in this film are so real and well-developed. How difficult it must have been to love someone of the same gender in 1991, or how hard it must have been to wait for your love for 31 years. Just as a son who can't understand his aging father, who is slipping away from reality, but with knowledge of the past, suddenly truly understand and love him. (The scene of the son bathing his father in 2022 is probably my absolute favorite, as is the ending itself).I was completely absorbed by it in every way-whether by the beautiful scenes, the theme of time travel, the cast, the costumes, or the music. I don't categorize this film as BL, or a gay film, or even an Asian film; it belongs in the general category of all films and has become one of my absolute favorites. It is my wish for this film to reach as many viewers as possible. It's true that not everyone may understand it, or not on the first viewing, but the creators made it in such a way that we cannot say who understands it and who doesn't. Everyone can perceive it in their own way; everyone can see something different in it, or a different detail may matter to them. It can evoke different questions and answers in each person-or perhaps leave them unanswered-but emotionally, I believe most people will agree that it touches the soul. It is unique and exceptional. And I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to recommend it to absolutely everyone.",

However, in Giger's book \"Necronomicon II,\" Giger says that director Ronald W. Moore was who he dealt with. Giger goes on to say that he felt manipulated by Moore, who told him in tears that the film would lose its financing without the Giger poster. Whatever the case, the original art did eventually end up in Neal's possession, along with numerous other prints and portfolios by Giger, lending credence to Neal's claims of involvement.",

And of course I opted to sit down and watch it given the recent years flood of creature features that has been spewing forth from the Chinese cinema; some good, some not so good.Writers Dada Huang and Zhaosheng Huang put together an entertaining enough script for the movie. It is mindless entertainment, where you just grab your snack, lean back and enjoy the humans vs. Aliens action on the screen. There is very little to think about in the movie, and it doesn't make much of any sense; especially when you see how the aliens effortlessly tore through platoons of soldiers, and yet we are to believe that three sole survivors are capable of overcoming the alien overlord invasion. Sure...The narrative in the movie was dull and slow paced, so very, very slow paced. I ended up giving up on finish watching the movie about halfway through. By then I was just so bored with the lack of any real story progress, and the stale narrative, that I just didn't want to keep watching.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, but the Chinese cast were nicely cast and put on good performances, whereas the non-Chinese cast put on mostly dubious and questionable performances, especially the platoon leader in the beginning of the movie.Visually then \"Zhandi: Yìzhong Haojie\" was okay. The CGI effects are good, but of course not a match for the top of the line Hollywood productions. But for a Chinese movie such as this, then the effects were actually quite good.My rating of director Zhaosheng Huang's 2022 movie \"Zhandi: Yìzhong Haojie\" lands on a four out of ten stars.",

The movie shows literally one person all the time and he's constantly talking on the phone with various people, so as the story unfolds, we only HEAR it. We hear some voices, sometimes we see some parts of other people's bodies, but there is never any physical interaction (well, there is one, but no spoilers here). There is just one guy running around, driving his car or a bicycle and he's calling someone non-stop.Also, the color grading is pushing the film into the Mexican territory. I mean, everything is so yellow and unnatural looking. But it's supposed to be L. A.I didn't enjoy the film. I've had a feeling that something is missing, although I liked the theme of recovering parts of alien tech from the sea. I guess there is a lot of potential in this idea. Just poorly executed here.",

The town looks vintage, and they were able to even get some classic cars. The zombies had some legit SFX to them and not the typical gray face makeup. It boasted a large cast and each group had their own subplot so it was not just having people around for zombie bait. Just a good amount of comedy keeps part of the film light, but the film gets harsh and gory when it needs to. The story is witty and does take cues form other zombie films but does so by honoring them.A film like this should be on the radar of the larger horror community. It was on Shudder or the likes, it would blow up. It reminds me of the zombie film The Dead Next Door in the 90s. The production team at Acrostar films deserves all the awards and praise it has gotten for this film. Good job! Can't wait for the sequel.",

            "storyline": "Needless to say that I had actually never heard about this 2022 horror sci-fi movie titled \"The Area 51 Incident\", prior to stumbling upon it by random chance here in 2024. And of course, with it being a horror movie of sorts, and a movie that I hadn't already seen, then I opted to sit down and give director Rhys Frake-Waterfield's 2022 movie a fair chance.Truth be told, I virtually had no idea what I was in for here. So writers Tom Jolliffe, Rhys Frake-Waterfield and Scott Chambers had every opportunity readily available to impress and entertain me with \"The Area 51 Incident\". But I have to admit that I wasn't really harboring the biggest of expectations to the movie, given the movie's dubious cover.The storyline was pretty straightforward, but actually at the same time it wasn't anything overly noteworthy or particularly interesting. It was a rather mundane, if not actually bland, script and storyline that the writers concocted for the movie. Sort of a very standard alien invasion type of movie, in the likes of \"Alien\", except not as entertaining or memorable. The movie was sort of a cliché, in lack of better words. Sort of think if \"The Strain\" and \"Alien\" had a baby, then this movie would be it, except it didn't prove nowhere as interesting or entertaining as neither of them.I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list, I will say that the acting performances were actually fair, despite the fact that the script and material they had to work with was mundane.The CGI animated aliens in the movie looked rather questionable, and that somewhat took away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. Alien movies such as this needs proper effects to be effective, and having subpar CGI effects just really doesn't cut it for me.While I did manage to endure through the entire 81 minutes that the movie ran for, I was not overly impressed or particularly entertained by director Rhys Frake-Waterfield's 2022 movie. And it is definitely not a movie that I will ever return to watch again. Nor is it a movie that I would recommend for diehard sci-fi fans to sit down and watch.My rating of \"The Area 51 Incident\" lands on a three out of ten stars. Points awarded for the sheer effort they put into this project.",

He noted, \"It is very hard to get abs like that.\" But the training paid off and the film-makers complimented Cotta for achieving the shredded physique of a soccer star.

There is nothing endearing about a non-script micro budget film that tests your patience. It is not strange, it is not a cult film candidate, what it is, is a mess of a movie. The acting, effects, and everything else, reeks of \"let's finish this thing\", no matter if it makes any sense, let's just get it finished. Beware, \"Invader\" will not meet your expectations for a low budget sci-fi, because there is really no story being told. It is simply a mish-mash of bad acting, bad script, and marginal special effects. - MERK",

Seems they prefer to please the world rather than bring a genuine Christian \"fantasty\" movie. A \"fabled good king\"? Meaning God?\nThe acting, the special effects, the story, it is all bad as can be.

It helps to know Africa a bit when you see it, because Bekolo is not trying to make the usual huts-and-boubous-film, but is trying to show the emotional realities of living in a corrupt, polluted, city where prostitution is rife and idealism is punished. The censorship board of Cameroon has not yet decided whether to censor it, supposedly for its sexual content but probably for its political stands. It's a pretty direct commentary on Cameroon's present government. I think the film misses its aims slightly, but that's because he was trying to do too much. He wants to show women prevailing, daring to fight back, to stand up, and he wants to adapt an African ritual (mevungu) in a modern form. He wants to make a political statement in a time when it's dangerous or irrelevant to do so. I still don't exactly get the turns of the plot, but I don't think the plot's that important. I enjoyed the images, even the MTV-ish ones, I enjoyed the references to other films, and I enjoyed the slapstick butchery, stuff you won't see in any other African film by any one else.",

The film laboratory at the Romanian National Film Studios in Buftea were used to processing Eastman Kodak stock, and were initially unable to process the East German ORWO negative. After re-calibrating the Romanian lab equipment, it was able to process the ORWO stock, albeit with a soft contrast look that the director and DP liked. As a result, all of the footage subsequently shot at the Babelsberg Studios in East Germany was shipped on a daily basis to Romania for processing.",

The worst part is the ridiculous script involving a theft and the attempts from the band of robbers to recover their booty they had lost somehow. To extract the information from the snatchers, the two female leads, use their sexual power to cause such sexual ecstasy that no one can resist. Indeed, the two guys who snatch the money withstand beatings and torture but can't resist the sexual torment. There is a laughable 'special' bed where the people having sex forward intense signals enough to torture the guy wearing a head piece wired to the bed to torture him. There is an unusual torture of a woman with eels threatening to find their way into any cavity of her body by bathing the eels with sake!. There is some contorted explanation of this unique power which is a pretext to show gratuitous sex scenes. These scenes lack eroticism or any artistic value. Overall soft core trash here, in Japan or anywhere else for that matter.",

Even more difficult is combining the protagonists' own love story with the main flow of the film. The casts were also chosen correctly, as a film like this, especially in the Asian market must be led by more \"serious\" actors. The ending to me is a little questionable, while it makes sense, but seems a bit out of character as well. Nevertheless, an impressive accomplishment of piecing together a believable future. Love the analogy of this science to Chinese concept of \"soul\", there seems to be a lot more than what meets the eye to this film.",

Most of time-reaction plot works were copycat, but the phone gently refuse those mistake. In police station sequence, smart presentation of time-reaction with a single notepad. Brilliant. Decent watch for whole two hours. Screenplay guy and the crew made it well done. Tracing sequence in lantern march was stunning, and the lawyer's house looks beautiful. Fine work. Recommended.

Ghosts don't appreciate that very much. Bring in burned-down place with plenty of ghosts in it and go for it.It's certainly on par with other horror movies that don't quite work despite having 100 times the budget and big names attached to them. Ghost Project's makers' next project will be much more polished and it's a workable first effort to be honest. The basics are all there, some well executed (jump scares and general mood mostly work), some not so much (love scenes only work if there was chemistry between the characters before it - but big movies make that mistake too).As I said.

Well, this is an interesting movie if you're really bored.  It's got lots of beautiful women, and just as many sex scenes.  And the reason for that is the movie just takes a lot of those scenes from other movies, low budget, eh?  Especailly, Emily Dale was in one of the fantasies, and later on she appears in reality as Kelly, yet no one recognizes her as the women from the VR. Anyway, you can't expect much for a movie like this, but it does give your eye a feast as it puts the sex scenes from many movies in this movie.  So it succeeds at putting a lot of sex into the movie while there are only two scenes that are original in this movie. Anyway, to conclude in one sentence, this movie is not too original, got a lot of beautiful woman and somewhat OK sex scenes, cut and paste from other movies, and there isn't much to this movie other than those.  Then again, I don't think this movie is going for anything else.",

This thing is so low budget, they couldn't even afford to shoot the opening scene in a video store ... in even a replica set of a video store. The two \"actors\" are in front of a green screen with a video store scene projected behind them. That should have been enough to warn me away from this, but no... I had to be stubborn and sit through another 15 minutes of this torture.All of the \"actors\" are unattractive, overacting hacks. The \"script\" is non-existing nonsense. The \"chickens\" are felt puppets that make a sock puppet look high tech. There is not a single positive thing I can say about this \"movie\" other than the fact that I was able to turn it off.No, movies do not need a big budget to be good, but they do need SOME KIND of budget!",

As one of the main characters narrates the story in a rather magical aesthetic, it is visually manipulated, there's the use of this effect of having a hand from outside the action lighting cigarettes or wiping yogurt off the mute guy's face, while at other times a computer menu simply irrupts into the scene to do things like flushing the toilet, adding the right music or setting the moon's phase, amongst many other things like texts, censorship bands or a couple of interruptions with \"Movie Quizzes\" where the mute re-enacts a film and you have options displayed. Add some really colorful characters like a girl allergic to light, a rather creepy mayoress, the circus people and the TV clips by the mute guy's journalist mother and her guests, and you have a film that's really fun to watch.",

You can watch it, you'll forget it quickly.The main question is what was invented earlier - the main plot or the advertising inserts of the fast payment system, and only then the plot was adjusted to them?Amir (the director) sold his soul and added a brazen advertisement for a fast payment system to the film. There's a fat, fat minus for that. Go to the movie if you want to see silly, awkward promotional inserts. Pay for a movie ticket with a card, it's convenient and fast :)",

Because episodes don't end in \"cliffhangers,\" some serial \"purists\" refuse to accept it into the serial canon. Unlike short subject series, the episodes follow a definite story arc, which becomes incomprehensible to the viewer if shown out of order. Post-1948 films were shown on early-to-mid 1950s TV, often while still being available for theatrical showings as well. The mass syndication of postwar product by Republic Pictures resulted in many theaters boycotting the distributor. The records of the New York State Censorship Board at the New York State Archives clearly show that all twelve episodes of this serial were submitted for approval and licensing for theatrical exhibition in that state in 1953.",

And one always seems to need an inhaler for asthma. And several think they can out run giant creatures. The scripts, with some variations, are all cookie cutter. This time it is set at a company using genetic splicing to create new creatures. The t-Rex is spliced from dinosaur, alligator and chameleon and some snake. So as part chameleon, it simply can disappear against the background. The snakes are spliced from different snakes, and get quite big. And of course it is a scientist doing things the company is not supposed to be doing. The CGI snakes are quite garish colored, and the t-Rex is all right, but later in the film gets some interesting color streaks. The idea is somewhat inventive, they simply need an inventive script.",

Sent to attack and they seemed unnecessary the one thing I did like was the ship itself and the costumes after that it's worth a watch or two? It's a basic movie that I'd see once.

            "storyline": "ICE is one of the most attractive black-and-white achievements ever made, a remarkable film set in a totalitarian regime in the United states, that's centered in NYC. The episodic script revolves around an underground leftist organization as they plan guerrilla activities, imagining a mass urban insurrection in New York. They protest American influences in Mexico, deal with internal disputes, and eventually coordinate a major, city-wide, heavily armed offensive against the State.Often bizarre, dialogues act as a distorted segment of some philosophical discussion or move along absurd paths of a labyrinth from which there is no way out. Characters whose patterns of behaviour are unusual, the psyche is torn, emotions are pushed into the background, and some unexpected reactions quite understandably radiate coldness (and eventually come to a standstill), since they are completely separated from their environment. They are acted in Goddard's style, with occasional bursts of theatricality. What allows Robert Kramer to keep this (experimental) construction stable, and it becomes clear in the first few minutes, is the flawless and equally unconventional. Beautiful, fascinating, and ultimately inscrutable ICE is a film that haunts with its refusal to explain itself and is likely to reverberate in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. I recommend this to the fans of The Killing of America (1981), Peter Watkins Punishment Park (1971), Miklós Jancsó's Silence and Cry (1968), Haskell Wexler's Medium Cool (1969), Kazuo Hara's Extreme Private Eros: Love Song (1974), Gilles Groulx's The Cat in the Bag (1964), John Gianvito's The Mad Songs of Fernanda Hussein (2001), Memories of Underdevelopment (1968) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Vampires of Poverty (1977) directed by Carlos Mayolo & Luis Ospina.",

I have to admit that I found the storyline in \"The Park\" laughably boring and ridiculous. It was, as I had believed, just another movie that uses the trope of all-adults-in-the-world-are-dead. It has been seen and done before, and writer and director Shal Ngo didn't exactly bring anything new or thrilling to the game.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble, but the acting performances were fair enough, despite the fact that I abhorred the storyline and script.Truth be told, then I didn't finish watching \"The Park\", and nor do I have any intentions of returning to attempt doing so, because the storyline utterly failed to entertain me.My rating of \"The Park\" lands on a three out of ten stars.",

The 1942 Rose Bowl was especially memorable to movie audiences because it was the only game in Rose Bowl history that was not played in Pasadena, California. Following the U.S. entry into the war, it was feared that the Pasadena game would be an ideal target for the Japanese, so the game was played at Duke University in North Carolina. On January 1, 1942, Oregon State defeated Duke University, by a score of 20-16.",

The music was great too, and helped steer the emotions.The movie left me wanting to know more about the back story, hence my general confused state throughout. But I'm guessing this leaves it open for a sequel or a prequel.I have never seen a Turkish film (or a Middle Eastern one) with a female action star... so I hope this trend continues. Kudos for going against the grain in a male-dominated culture. As an Executive Producer, this is my first time watching the finished product... but my 8/10 score is unbiased.

Hitchhiker's Guide and the original Doctor Who were in my backyard, too. The ambience and spirit of those swashbuckling adventures inspired me, entertained me, made me laugh and made me think.All that atmosphere and character is alive and well in The Stratum. The beauty of those films was their ability to hide a message of hope and courage amidst a sprawling story, and do it on a budget. Special effects were more practical and so the heavy lifting was done with dialogue and acting.Crash Buist and Lauren Senechal deliver that, and more, with chemistry, ingenuity, and zeal. Stratum is one of those rare independent films that plucks on your heartstrings without telling you it will, and does it with a wink and a smile.The dystopian future, the rogue hacker with a twinge of innocence, the plucky princess with a plan, and the duplicitous CEO; you'll find them here, but updated and real.You can feel the joy that went into making the movie in every frame. And, at the end of the day, you might walk away inspired, to not only see the world a little differently, but maybe to try and change it, too.",

One day, David is adopted from the orphanage by the stern Ms. Victoria (Maribel Martin), only to find that his new home is a research facility where children like him are studied in an attempt to create some kind of supermen. Hearing that the uncivilized blacks of Africa have a prophecy about a white \"child of the moon\", the little misfit escapes, taking with him two other research specimens, Edgar (David Sust) and Georgina (Lisa Gerrard, best known as one half of Dead Can Dance).This film has been unavailable for many years and is mainly forgotten. I imagine that most people searching for it are fans of Dead Can Dance wanting to see Lisa Gerrard's only acting credit and hear DCD's film score. Both are disappointments. Gerrard has no especial acting talent and she only succeeds in serving the story here because her character is written as borderline-retarded. Her dialogue is dubbed into Spanish too. For the most part, Dead Can Dance's soundtrack is generic synthesizer tones, and only at a brief few seconds do we hear material similar to that of their album of the same year THE SERPENT'S EGG.The first half of EL NIÑO DE LA LUNA is basically shots of David in anguish alternating with foreboding images of the moon. The encounter of David with the black tribe is about as fair a depiction of Sub-Saharan Africa as Tintin in the Congo. This is a bad film, and one that provokes bafflement. We find a godawful script tied to lavish production values (especially set design and costumes). Who put up the money for this? And once it was inexplicably committed to film, who picked this as Spain's official entry for the Cannes Film Festival of that year? These are questions.",

The movie itself was about 20 or so minutes too long. It also could have used some better editing. The camera stayed on the scene for too long in a lot of scenes.Then there's the whole thing about it being labeled a sci-fi flick. I think that's a bit misleading. Overall, the movie was okay.

On the back lot tour ride, in Hollywood Studios, you used to be able to get on the ride and it would drive right by the ship . They have since closed that ride and it is no longer visible to the public. That ship, in particular, has deteriorated over the last 20 years of sitting outside weathering the elements. It's very dilapidated and also missing part of the top of the ship due to hurricane and tropical storm activity in Florida over the years. The second ship was refurbished and now resides as a sign in Tomorrowland, the Magic Kingdom, atop a shop and is painted red with additional rocket boosters. Most people don't even recognize it because it was so heavily modified after they refurbished it. You actually have to know where it is to find it. After you located it's pretty obvious though.",

            "storyline": "FLATWOODS is a mixed real footage/found footage/mockumentary based on a real event that happened in the Flatwoods, West Virginia in 1952. A group of people reported seeing a creature with distinctly alien features subsequent to the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the same area.The movie creates a fictional story around the daughter of one of the witnesses who decades later tries to get to the bottom of things via making a documentary. Naturally, she uncovers a deadly conspiracy.The cinematic aspects of this film are extremely uneven. The special effects are not half bad, and some of the shots reveal a good eye for composition. But then, many of the dramatic scenes seem downright amateurish. The editing is choppy, which is exacerbated by the frequent test signal screen transitions. The story is trite and full of conspiracy cliches. It also ends rather abruptly, which is surprising given the short running time. Maybe the budget ran out.On the content side, the film seems to be geared toward the crowd that has already bought into reptilian conspiracy theories, which appear to have their origin in the science fiction TV series V (1983).I did not know about the Flatwoods incident and therefore consulted Wikipedia to attain a bit of a background. That is when I became aware that the film strawmans skeptical arguments. In an interview with one of the experts, he lists two skeptical arguments, that the witnesses were high on moonshine or on paint, and then (with the interviewer) giggles at the silliness of these suggestions which obviously just reflect desperate efforts at a massive cover-up. In contrast, the Wikipedia article mentions a documented meteor on that date in combination with the possibility of the sighting of a barn owl which, viewed from a certain angle with the brush underneath, might have given the appearance of a much larger alien figure.Whatever it was, the movie would have been elevated by engaging with skeptical arguments more seriously. Because the conspiracy seems so far out, when it is finally revealed, it actually just reveals the wide gap between how seriously the movie takes itself and how seriously it can be taken by someone who is not already a believer in reptilians.The only part of this movie worth watching is the \"UFO in the woods\" scene at the very beginning.",

However, Lewis was a star, 12 times named to the Top Ten list of Box Office Stars, six times with partner Dean Martin (with whom he was the top star of 1952), and six times solo (ranking as high as #3 in 1958). He got the part.",

The lead role actor also should not be overlooked. He does a phenomenal job and he and Steven work so well together. Also for all of you who don't know Stephen was paid a total of 1800 dollars for this movie. 1800 DOLLARS!!! That's like 10 Popeyes chicken sandwiches and a copy of Elden Ring.",

It could also not circumnavigate the world. Later in the 1960s, it was used to shoot underwater films for various movie companies and TV productions in the clear waters off Florida and The Bahamas. Initially built by Martine's Diving Bells of San Diego California at a cost of $1.5 million, it was purchased in the early 1980s by Six Flags for $500,000 to be displayed at its Atlantis water park in Dania, FL and then by nearby Grand Prix Race-O-Rama for only $12,500 in October 1992. Sadly the Submanaut was cut up on-site and sold as scrap in the early 2000s.",

I would highly recommend you watch season 2 before this learn from my mistake, here's hoping chapter 3 makes more sense with it being 9 episodes in 140 minutes.

            "storyline": "By the early 70s, Mexican wrestler Santo was a huge figure in Mexican cinema. However, his formula of action and comedy that was very successful in his horror/action films of the 60s, began to take a campier, kitsch tone during the 70s. Taking away the previous mystical origins of Santo and with an huge influence of Bond films, \"Santo contra los Secuestradores\" (1973) started the trend of Santo as an special Interpol agent. The same year, \"Santo contra el Doctor Muerte\" followed up this trend and perfected it the style creating the now familiar image of the suave wrestler-by-day/agent-by-night that Santo carried during the 70s.The plot starts as mysterious criminal (Antonio Pica), damages the famous painting \"Los Borrachos\" during its exhibition on a Mexican museum. Spain's government demands an investigation and soon the Interpol suspects that Dr. Mann (Georges Rigaud), the man hired for the restoration of the painting is in fact behind its damage. Since his wrestling tour will take him to Spain, Special Agent Santo is called to work incognito. With the aid of agent Paul (Carlos Romero Marchent) Santo will infiltrate in Dr. Mann's castle in Spain to discover the mystery behind the painting's' damage, a mystery that involves the use of kidnapped women in bizarre scientific experiments.Owing a lot to the 70s bond films, the movie feels like an update to the Santo's character and a follow up to the humanization of his character. Santo is no longer the mystical warrior or the crime-fighting scientist, he is an Interpol agent who uses his status as Wrestling champion to make his work easier. Rafael Romero Marchent handles the Bond-style action genre competently even when his work had been mainly on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre.While not groundbreaking or particularly special, Rafael Romero Marchent makes a film that works despite its limitations and successfully mixes the Bond-esquire elements with the Santo mythology paving the way for the iconic figure Santo would become during the 70s. Like in his westerns, Romero Marchent makes good use of his locations and the film looks very good for its low-budget. Something very remarkable are the action sequences that, albeit short, work extremely well and are among the most realistic on a Santo movie.Santo looks more comfortable in this new take on his character than in his early films. He is now a less superhuman character and is relatively more believable than his previous incarnations. Carlos Romero Marchent is very good as Paul, but with the exception of some great scenes, the potential of his character is never exploited. Antonio Pica and Georges Rigaud are superb as the villains and they are probably among the best actors in the cast.Although not a kitsch extravaganza like the previous \"Santo contra la Hija De Frankenstein\", the movie is entertaining and filled with Santo's light-hearted comedy (both voluntary and involuntary). The campy tone of the previous films is still here but the approach, as other aspects in the movie, is based on the style of Bond films. This may probably be a flaw as fans of Bond-style action films may not like the Santo elements and at the same time, fans of typical Santo films may feel like the Bond elements are not part of Santo.\"Santo contra el Doctor Muerte\" is definitely a love it or hate it movie. In my opinion the mix works and while it is not a perfect film it makes good entertainment for 95 minutes. 6/10",

The story is really generic, with scientists making this solution to help the environment, but it goes very wrong. Other than using genetic cockroaches, it goes through the same formula, just like any other movie, and doesn't do anything new with it. There are two weird parts of the movie where the cockroaches control a dead body to get inside, and somehow, the queen starts talking to the characters. Other than that, the movie is repetitive with the characters fleeing the cockroaches, going to a part of a ship, and one of the them get killed off. It gets pretty predictable throughout, and I already guess who is going to survive the movie. The movie itself is suspenseful with them trying to survive against these cockroaches, and it gets entertaining during the climax of the movie. The movie ends with an environment message, which is done before.",

            "storyline": "In an unspecified future, Taranto is now divided into two distinct halves, with the \"poorer\" one under the yoke of various criminal gangs, in particular The Ants, the most fearsome and mysterious, which the young Pietro and Christian, known as \"Mondocane\" and \"Pisciasotto\", will join: the two, who have always lived together on the road and are able to carry out the most difficult tasks, are marked by their respective weaknesses and insecurities which will continue to crack their fraternal relationship.First time director Alessandro Celli completely transforms the area, bringing us into a truly separate world, as familiar as it is different, in which most of what was once is now irretrievably lost.Surely the technical side is what best stands out and gives emblematic identity to the whole, especially the photography, made up of alienating shades of yellow and dark.The direction also proves to be solid, especially in the great action sequences staged at their best, but weakened by an excellent but at times too quick editing in making the narration flow, as well as the screenplay itself, which in proposing a story full of the most classic canons but not for this obvious nor boring, it outlines a lot of very interesting ideas which, however, are developed in an incomplete or too fast way at times, perhaps setting aside the dystopian element too much, not going too deeply into the origins or consequences of this new Italy.The cast is made up of professionals and newcomers who do all their best, with the two young protagonists in particular finely holding up their natural bond, even if marked by a slight imbalance in the evolution of their relationship; all under the aegis of the always excellent Alessandro Borghi, who goes us an articulate character able to pass with incomparable fluidity from the most friendly availability to the cruelest ferocity, helping and at the same time exploiting the younger misfits to carry on his own war against the world.Like every debut, therefore, a title with all the strengths and weaknesses of the case, which gives us back a work that is still immature at times, but already strong in a fresh and well-orchestrated vision, worthy of the most international products from every point of view. And which gives hope, ironically, for an even more revolutionary and radiant future.",

The soundtrack is incessant drumbeat; sometimes there are layered sounds such as \"music\", police siren, sounds of actors, etc. but the music conquers all for its constant boring beat. The action from before halfway got really silly; we were supposed to believe that some hired guns would have sub-machine guns and other weapons as if going to war, and acting as if that was the case when it was just a trio of scientists they were up against. Really this was 2 out of 10 because of the above but somehow I was held, so there must have been something more interesting than the usual ... possibly some reasonable acting.",

Scope, the protagonist, is sent to a planet that is very similar to earth. Here, his landing is both expected and hailed. He is proclaimed as a hero and can have anything he wants. However, there is a pretty big catch involved.The world Scope finds himself in is an ugly, cheap one, one whose citizens crave entertainment, and the government bureaucracy gives it to them, through the country's \"heroes.\" All of this is conveyed in a darkly humorous, satirical manner. This humor could be hit and miss at times. I got tired of the cannibal jokes, but other jokes hit. What I liked most how the film was able to convey a futuristic world with almost no special effects.Ga, Ga: Glory to the Heroes is worth checking out for the more adventurous science-fiction fan.",
