            "storyline": "Directed by Orlando von Einsiedel, Lali Houghton, and Jorge Duran, \"The Lost Children\" is a powerful and moving documentary that follows the harrowing experience of four young siblings who become lost in the vast and treacherous Amazon rainforest after a tragic plane crash. The film not only highlights the physical trials faced by the Mucutuy children but also explores the emotional and psychological impacts of their struggle.The documentary begins with a concise introduction to the Mucutuy family, setting the context for their ill-fated journey from their isolated home near Araracuara to San José del Guaviare. The filmmakers expertly blend archival footage, interviews, and dramatic reenactments to craft a compelling narrative that draws viewers into a world divided yet united in the quest to save these young lives. Initially, the Indigenous people of the forest, who formed the rescue teams, did not collaborate with the army soldiers, leading to separate search efforts. However, as the weeks passed and the urgency to find the children intensified, both groups began to support one another, ultimately forging friendships. This search operation, dubbed Operation Hope, unexpectedly united the people of Colombia, showcasing a historic collaboration between soldiers and Indigenous communities that led to successful outcomes.The directors have skillfully balanced the documentary's emotional depth with moments of lightness and warmth, while also addressing broader themes of loss, hope, and the resilience of the human spirit, resulting in a profoundly impactful viewing experience.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. After so many decades of groups fighting to gain acceptance and rights and freedom, it seems recently there has been entirely too much focus on removing rights from some. Likely the most harrowing example of this is what's described as lightning striking in August 2021 when the Taliban entered Afghanistan. Documentarian Sahra Mani goes deep inside the country to show and tell the personal stories of three Afghan women.Life is described as \"normal\" prior to the Taliban takeover. Zahra was a working dentist and recently engaged to Omid. There is happiness in the families and community. Soon, Zahra's dental office becomes a clandestine meeting place for activists seeking a way to rebel without getting detained or tortured. Taranom struggles with the isolation that goes with living in a safe house away from her community, while Sharifa serves as the most common example of women stuck at home with few liberties. If you need a definition of systemic oppression, this film provides it.No education past sixth grade. No speaking in public. Very limited job opportunities. This new world finds women are first oppressed at home via fathers, brothers, and husbands, and then from a larger perspective by the Taliban. Activism and resistance require great courage, and those involved in the Civil Rebellion prefer peaceful protests, not violence. Their chants of \"Education is our right\" and \"Work, bread, education\" are simple and direct.Prevented from leaving the country - there's always a documentation issue with visas - the women who are able form backroom schools and work strategically against Taliban mandates. Zahar is even arrested and later goes missing for months. This is the life of women whose personal rights have been stripped. Director Sahra Mani ends with updates on Zahar, Taranom, and Sharifa, and the film serves as a gut-wrenching viewing experience for those who have gotten 'comfortable' with the phrase 'Taliban mandates'. This is a plea for attention and assistance. Producers on the film include Jennifer Lawrence and Malala Yousafzai.On Apple TV+ beginning November 22, 2024.",

Impressive and unique footage about what happens on the West Bank, particularly urgent nowadays when our newspapers and talk shows are focused on Gaza. As a logical consequence, the West Bank does not really exist for us, despite many similarities. In both areas, Israelian politics are steadily turning the law against the people living there. And we, at a safe distance, let it be and easily ignore the suffering and the constant humiliation of the Palestinians.What happens in the West Bank is rarely shown on TV or written about in newspapers. The footage in the movie at hand is unique and exposes how Israel turns the law around. They completely disregard the villagers and their rightful ownership, forcing complete households to move to caves, short of better options, while their houses are bulldozered one by one. Each time the army and bulldozers arrive, it is uncertain until the last moment which houses are to be destroyed.The soldiers who accompany the bulldozers are briefed that the people live there in illegally built houses. It is thus useless to yell at the soldiers and to call on their conscience, as they are spineless tools. The soldiers repeatedly say to people resisting that they only had to ask for an army permit, and all would be solved (but villagers know, and we know, that such a permit will never be issued).The politics behind the forced evacuation is appalling. We learn from secret documents that annexing that piece of land was not really intended to create a training area for the army, as repeatedly told by the invaders. Instead, its only purpose was to prevent the village from expanding.An issue that came about in the Q&A was if and how this footage can serve in a judicial investigation to establish war crimes against the Palestinians. New to me was that a considerable part of the soldiers involved are international and not native Israelian. Based on this material, they can be identified. Their acts can be prosecuted as it is generally deemed unlawful how Israel comes to these eviction orders.During the Q&A a very different important question was asked: how do you explain all this to the kids?? Denial is impossible, as they see it happen before their eyes. Anyway, it all leaves us speechless when we leave the venue after the screening. It happened for many years already, and still happens as shown here. It is even reinforced since the Gaza war, when nearby living settlers are even more than happy to help with the evictions, feeling entitled to revenge after 7th of October.",

I think it's so important for people to see what can happen behind closed doors and to break down the stigma of men being abused by women.However, Channel 5 have done their usual trick of creating two episodes when the content could easily fit into one and arguably would have been more impactful that way. The use of hidden camera footage is very repetitive. I thought the 1:1 interviews with the victim and police involved were good but would've been just as effective in podcast format.I watched this on Netflix and am a little surprised they bought it without condensing it, but I'm glad they did as it means I could watch it without ads and it'll gain a much wider audience!",

Yeah, there isn't much renewal to the shows, so once you've seen one, you've essentially seen them all. And that is sort of growing stale already. But hey, the good news is that if you are a diehard fan of Jeff Dunham, then you will definitely enjoy this 2024 holiday special.There were a couple of funny moments here and there, but I wasn't really brought to much laughter throughout the course of the 59 minutes that the show ran for.As always, it is Peanut that steals the show, and guess what? Also what happened in this comedy special.Now that I've seen the show, I can tick it off of the watch-list, and I can honestly say that I am not returning to watch it a second time.My rating of \"Jeff Dunham's Scrooged-Up Holiday Special\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

I had no interest in seeing that movie either, but I figured \"What the hell.\"So I make my way up to the theatre, purchase a glass of wine and I'm ready. I walk into the theatre room, and something is.....off. I find that I'm surrounded by many people 2, 3 or 4 times my age... okay. Then I get to my seat and a couple of seats to my left is a group of teenage girls, they seem theatre kids or band nerds.... Okay. Odd.Then the movie kicks in and I know that something is messed up here, it's Queen's Brian May talking about opera in a documentary style setting in Tuscany, Italy. And there's Ed Sheeran and all sorts of stuff. I have no idea what's happening. At this point I'm thinking someone put DMT or some other kind of hallucinogenic compound in my drink. The real movie begins, it's a blind Italian dude singing opera songs. It's all shot beautifully and sounds good. And then like Russell Crowe shows up and sings a song. And then out comes Johnny Depp and pretends to play guitar with Jeff Beck on the jumbo screen behind the orchestra. What. And THEN Kim and Chloe Cardassian show up. Between this and the recent 2024 election, I am now convinced that I have been absorbed into some sort of nightmarish alternate universe where things have gone horrifically and frighteningly wrong.So it turns out that they sent me an offer for the wrong screening time or something. At the end of the day, it was fine. I learned a lot about opera, Andrea Bocelli and Tuscany. I'm am certain that people who are fans of this type of fare with love this and I hope they get to see it on a big screen with a thunderous sound system like I did. I had no idea what I was looking at but I'm pretty sure that it was cool.",

Are any of the clients who seek out those who profess to have otherworldly powers out of their minds for doing so? And what about these so-called magic people? Do they truly believe in their ability to speak with the dead and see into the future? The film doesn't ask.Instead, this documentary on psychics who work around Manhattan doesn't judge its subjects. Rather, the viewer is simply presented with people (most of whom are frustrated, if not failed, actors) who are as confused and hurting as anyone who feels the need for supernatural guidance.Personally, I appreciated the lack of judgment throughout the picture. By not putting anyone on the defensive, we are allowed to glimpse this world with the mask off. None of the clairvoyants seem confident in their alleged powers. They all express doubt. One man is devastated when his attempt to read someone fails spectacularly, appearing genuinely hurt when his talent falters.In fact, the sadness throughout the film is hard to miss. As the movie reaches its conclusion, one thing becomes clear: we all carry a lot of trauma, and some of us are willing to try anything to resolve it. Humans don't want to believe that bad things happen just because they happen. We are desperate to make the incomprehensible make sense. And people don't care if you have to fabricate answers to give them that solace. After all, which would you prefer: a world where a little girl is shot dead and that's the end, or one where her death is the beginning of a brand new adventure?Of course, death is death. No, you don't go on to other things when you take your last breath. But while that may be the truth, the truth doesn't always set you free.",

He would have been 26 or 27.This \"documentary\" starts with a lie because the truth of Die Antwoord is too disgusting. Nothing after that lie can be trusted. This video is merely slick propaganda meant to rehabilitate their image. And they enlist their daughter, Sixteen, as their mouthpiece.The visuals and editing are reminiscent of their music videos.

According to Wolf: \"I like a documentary where you never know who'll pop up next. How cool is it that you wouldn't expect Kristine DeBell from Alice in Wonderland to pop up, or Camille Keaton from I Spit on Your Grave. Or Ken Davitian from Borat. These people all did interesting, talked-about, controversial nude scenes in their movies, and I think those are the stories, and those are the people, that make this documentary interesting. It's not just who you expect to see. It's, 'Oh my gosh, I can't believe they got that person.' Or, 'Oh wow, Mariel Hemingway is actually going to talk about her nudity in Star 80.'

The trailer made you expect spectacular scenery throughout, but instead we are mainly watching the kids and parents talking and playing. It essentially comes across as a home movie rather than a National Geographic production. A lot of the places they apparently visited, are glossed over, not even shown in photos.I want to wish the family well, and I hope the proceeds of this film go towards the research for a cure, but definitely this was more suited to the small screen like on the TLC channel, than in a movie theatre.",

The acting is skillful, with each performer adding depth to their roles, allowing the viewer to connect with both their fears and strengths. Additionally, the cinematography makes great use of shadows and close-ups, intensifying the feeling of dread and hopelessness. While some plot points may feel familiar to fans of disaster cinema, The Great Warning carves its own path by focusing on the psychological impact of imminent peril rather than relying solely on visual spectacle.

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. In 2022, Kathryn Ferguson released a documentary on singer and activist Sinead O'Connor. It was Ms. Ferguson's first feature-length documentary, after a few shorts and videos. This time out, her focus is on renowned actor Humphrey Bogart. Now, opening on your subject's funeral might be an unusual way to begin a profile, but the star-studded service drives home the point that Bogart's life touched many. He was true Hollywood royalty.One would expect the profile of one of the biggest movie stars of all time to provide a chronological rundown of his films. Although his film resume is certainly not short-changed, the director takes a more personal approach by structuring Bogie's life according to how the five most influential women impacted him. Those five are: his mother, Maud Humphrey, and his four wives (in order), Helen Menken, Mary Philips, Mayo Methot, and of course, Lauren Bacall. We are guided through each of these relationships, with neither good nor bad being withheld.Much of the time is spent with narrator Kerry Shale reciting Bogart's own words from writings, journals, letters, etc. Shale offers neither a mimic of Bogie's distinctive voice nor a smooth sound for our ears. Still, there is heft and meaning to Bogart's words, especially when they are synchronized with an incredible bounty of archival footage, film clips, and photographs. Numerous interviews are included from son Stephen Bogart, directors Howard Hawks and John Huston, and actress Kathryn Hepburn, as well as others. There is also plenty from Lauren Bacall, who famously met Bogart when she was a 19-year-old actress on the set of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT (1944). The two were married from 1945 through 1957 (his death). It was a true love story, and not nearly as tumultuous as his time with third wife Mayo Methot, who shot at him and stabbed him!There is a segment on Bogie's first career - a baby model - and his own words describe this relationship with his mother as he looks back at his childhood. We hear about his time in the Navy, as well as his love of chess and the water ... especially time spent sailing on his boat, Santana. We also hear about his quick temper and his alcoholism, and it's fascinating to learn that it was actress Greer Garson who heard his cough and insisted that he see a doctor - a visit that resulted in a cancer diagnosis.After years as a contract player in the studio system, it was HIGH SIERRA (1940) that set him on the road to superstardom. Bogart's career included such iconic roles as Sam Spade (THE MALTESE FALCON, 1941), Rick Blaine (CASABLANCA, 1943), Philip Marlowe (THE BIG SLEEP, 1946), and Lt Commander Queeg (THE CAINE MUTINY, 1954). One of my personal favorites was his role as Dixon Steele in Nicholas Ray's IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) with Gloria Grahame. When they hear the name Humphrey Bogart, many movie fans picture the trench coat, hat, and cigarette ... or the broken love story that begins a friendship. But there was much more behind the scenes. After directing Bogie to his only Oscar in THE AFRICAN QUEEN (1951), director John Huston delivered the eulogy at the funeral for his friend, also putting the final touches on this in-depth profile.Opens in select theaters on November 15, 2024.",

They granted the filmmakers access to hours of archive footage of Amy and her family, as well as giving the filmmakers' their blessing to interview Amy's family and friends. However, they - in particular, Amy's father, Mitch Winehouse - soon began to feel they were being misrepresented in the documentary, that the negative aspects of Amy's life were receiving much more attention than the positive, and that footage had been edited in order to produce an inaccurate narrative of Amy's story, especially the last three years of her life. Mitch Winehouse has said that Amy's fans should consider seeing the film for the rare, previously unseen, archive footage of his daughter, but should pay no attention to the film's general portrayal of her, which he has labeled \"preposterous\". Even after the film was nominated for an Academy Award as 'Best Documentary', Mitch Winehouse tweeted on 14 Jan. 2016: \"Still hate the film though.\"",

Immediately after the game, the players meet with the President of the Spanish Soccer Federation, and he promptly kisses one of the players on the lips. Almost immediately the moment goes viral around the world, baffling just about everyone: what has just happened here? At this point we are less that 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this movie is really and two-for-one: first, how did the Spanish Women's team actually win this against all odds, and despite the horrible treatment by the Spanish Soccer Federation, and second, the fallout of an unwanted kiss of one of the players by the President of the Spanish Soccer Federation. Please note that this documentary is bringing the perspective of the Spanish players. In that sense it's not really an \"objective\" or \"neutral\" documentary. On the other hand, this film synthesizes the sheer hell that these women went through, as team's head coach and the President of the Spanish Soccer Federation were completely out of touch with reality. At just over 90 min., this documentary just flew by. Please note that for whatever reason, the documentary's original tile in Spanish is quite different from what we are now seeing in the US.\"It's All Over: The Kiss That Changed Spanish Football\" recently started streaming on Netflix, and I just watched it the other night. If you are a fan of soccer or of women's rights, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

This claim has been repeated in several press statements and reviews, but it's not correct. What really happened is that, one month after his return in Europe, Simon went climbing in the Alps, unaware that the Daily Mail newspaper had published a wildly incorrect version of the Siula story, implying that Simon had tried to kill Joe. This was of course absurd, and the British climbing community dismissed it immediately as nonsense. However, back home Simon discovered that a small group of senior members of the Mount Everest Foundation (the body that manages founding for climbing expeditions in the Greater Ranges) had misjudged the story and now wanted Simon excluded in the future from the MEF funds - a move that could basically kill Simon's climbing career. At this point however, Joe Simpson had a correct version of the Siula story published in a respected climbing magazine, and the whole issue was cleared. However, in the DVD commentary, Joe Simpson himself clearly says that Simon came under much criticism after returning home, and that he wrote Touching the Void to defend Simon.",

To the unitiated, he indulges in the male gaze, engages in personal relationships with his models in order to get the perfect shot, his own unique vision to put on canvas while navigating the business side of commercial photography.Which in his case is to tell his bosses to shove off.I can respect that. I can also respect the way he works. Because from an artistic viewpoint, it isn't the male gaze at all. It's all about the way he sculpts the human body like a statue to fill the space and convey an emotion, to create an impact that the model communicates to the viewer.There is nothing prurient in this photographs; they are sensual with a hint of sexuality coupled with a bit of innocence, given the young ages of his models.That being said. This film gets more interesting when we see the conflict between artist and business managers. Artists vs. Models, and I would have loved to see even more of that.Bellemere's style can be seen as objectifying and toxic in today's climate. There may be some truth to that. Sometimes I would scream, \"You need a contortionist! Not a print model!\"But when it's all laid out for the talent to do her poses, we understand they had some inkling of what they were getting into.Another flaw is the lack of diversity of the models chosen, but that is the nature of the beast. There is one curvy model but she was hardly a \"plus-size\" in mundane terms. There were poses that busty, \"Playboy\" type models would never be able to pull off, so I get it.Is Bellemere's art beautiful? Yes. Is it impersonal? Also, yes.Does it also show the world a realistic side of nude photography that isn't connected to adult entertainment? Absolutely. But I did wish there was more of this discussion from the model's POV.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. They consider themselves \"the guardians of the sea\". My guess is that most of us have never heard of the haenyeos, the women divers on Jeju Island in South Korea. Director Sue Kim introduces us to these remarkable women who are carrying on a tradition that dates back to the 14th century.We learn the haenyeo practice sustainable seafood harvesting. They dive \"with their own air\", which means no air tanks - just their lungs. Their equipment is limited to a wetsuit, a hook, and a net basket. The underwater photography is spectacular and has us diving alongside these women who admit to disliking sea urchins, which require intensive labor to get to the good part. Director Kim dedicates separate segments to a few of the women, and what we immediately realize is that every haenyeo is a tough woman living a tough life.What we also recognize is the passion, commitment, and camaraderie. Not only are they talented divers and fisherwomen, they have a community of respect and friendship. However, the picture is not all rosy. Their tradition is being threatened on many fronts. The divers have been pushed out to deeper water due to trash in the water. They have also noted a distinct shortage of sea life from their younger days, and attribute this to the warmer water from climate change. Beyond these threats, the women are facing generational differences. Most divers are in their 60's and 70's, and very few younger women care to carry on this tradition. The haenyeo numbers peaked in the 1960's with 30,000 divers, whereas now the count is fewer than 4000.The most recent threat to the sea and the haenyeo comes from Japan and the proposal to dump nuclear wastewater from Fukushima into the sea to minimize radioactivity. The fear is the danger to all sea life for the foreseeable future. This threat inspired one of the elder divers, Soon Deok, to travel to Switzerland and deliver a personal statement to the Human Rights Council, followed by official protests.In addition to the group of elderly divers, director Kim introduces a couple of thirty-somethings who have joined the haenyeos, and have utilized YouTube and TikTok to document the sea changes and generate some attention for the profession. Haenyeos have been recognized by UNESCO, and their work is as fascinating as the personalities of the women. However, the long list of threats cannot be overlooked, and perhaps the notoriety this film will bring can make a difference. One of the producers is renowned activist Malala Yousafzai and it's distributed by A24.Releasing on Apple TV+ on October 11, 2024.",

Both disability and having some interracial relationships in the past.From the start you could see the family was going to be the issue. Example, mother seriously needs to cut the apron strings, she's just keeping Derrick tied down and isolated because she doesn't want to be alone. Her husband left her due time him. Like they said and she don't want the child she choose over husband to leave. She acts just like my dude mom has acted and has said the same things. She even guilt trips him whenever he tries to stand up to her. Brings up the time he was in the hospital for 5 months in a coma and having seizures, that she was there everyday and no one else.The brother is super raciest as well. Saying Derrick doesn't like our gospel music, because of Anna. That he never cried like that in front is a white woman. Why does it matter if she's whites. Why not just say, I never cried like that in front of a woman in a professional setting? Everything was about black and white with him.As far as, Anna I'm conflicted. It's hard to know exactly Derrick's mindset, but I do believe he's a grown man. Even if they act like his mentality is of that of a 12 month old. I do find it odd she knew so much about him and his life for her manipulating his hand and thoughts. Specially after Anna stopped coming around, he was showing signs of distress and self harm.However, common sense like never bring up your sex life with anyone outside your lover and friend zone... never parents or in-laws. That's why I feel if she really was raping him she wouldn't bring it up.I agree and believe people with special needs don't have low intelligence and that we can all learn to communicate. My son whose autistic show's me this everyday. He might not be verbal, but we find ways around to communicate. Be it pictures or sign language, that way he's not getting frustrated as easily and so he knows that he's not being isolated and not heard; and so he knows he has a voice.",

It is a fantastic portrait of childhood and the human personal growth that keeps unfolding, how we learn and how we belong to something. My absolute biggest recommendations.",

He moved so well, like one of the things in Back to the Future (1985), where he slid across the hood of the DeLorean. To see him how he is now, I think it's really hard, but RIGHT AWAY, you see that sparkle in his eye, and you forget about it because he's still so charismatic. And funny.

But just reading the temperature in the room, reading the facial expressions, we understood, despite our language skills, or lack of skills, we knew exactly what was happening. We knew that something explosive was being recorded. I remember filming and Maria Pevchikh's jaw, this is Navalny's chief investigator, she's depicted in the scene.

There is an amazing story of grit and survival against all odds that would have been better retold in an action movie, but Tim Jarvis would not have been its central focus.Shackleton: The Greatest Story of Survival comes across to me as little more than the vanity project of a man obsessed with reliving the life of an explorer who captured his imagination. The documentary plays out with Jarvis regaling the audience about his own excursions to emulate the arduous journey of Shackleton and his crew - here is me traipsing through Antarctica in the insufficient attire and equipment that Shackleton used in 1914, but let's ignore the modern gadgetry and film crew I have at my disposal to make sure the world gets to see me LARPing as Shackleton.The most tone-deaf aspect of Jarvis' ego-massaging endeavour is the half-hearted call to environmentalism and combating climate change in the latter third of the documentary - here is where the glacier was almost 100 years ago, and this is how much it has receded. I wonder how much money he and his entire crew have spent in recreating Shackleton's adventures and funding this self-indulgent documentary that could have gone into actual efforts to protect the environment. No one else, historian or environmentalist, was invited to offer insights into Shackleton and his ordeal or discuss the environmental catastrophe facing Antarctica, because it's the Tim Jarvis show.",

He is one of the 4 who robbed Banco Rio in January, 2006 in Buenos Aires. The other three are nicknamed \"The Actor\", \"The Thug\" and \"The Engineer\". When asked why he did it, The Artist, the brainchild behind it all, says he had a revelation one day to rob a bank, and then took 2 years to plan it... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this documentary reflects on the \"robbery of the century\", the astounding amount of planning that went into it, and the aftermath. Please note that much of the documentary is simply letting the 4 main guys talk about it, and then re-enact what exactly they did. There is surprisingly little archive footage mixed into it, and that really holds the documentary back. I'm not a big fan of re-enactments in documentaries to begin with. Nevertheless, the amount of details that went into planning the heist is what held my interest. Then comes the last 25-30 minutes...\"The Bank Robbers: The Last Great Heist\" premiered earlier this week on Netflix. If you are interested in true crime and in documentaries, even with all of the re-enactments, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

It got this way because 30-50 years ago child abuse was perhaps, too easily overlooked, but just like everything else..... things swung to the opposite extreme direction. What's even scarier, are people who REALLY think they are doing the right thing, not realizing they are being driven by any and everything but what is right ethically and morally. I hope this opens up some eyes and hearts, but that we don't go all crazy and swing crazy opposite again. When will we learn?",

            "storyline": "Just before the 2010s, horror fans began being treated to loving retrospective documentaries on horror franchises, with 2010's \"Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy\" being the gold standard. That doc's writer, Thommy Hutson, pulls double-duty here as writer and director, and it's difficult not to compare them because they're structured in the same manner -- but the result is almost as a good.The first film gets the most luxurious treatment, with a full 90 minutes of the running time devoted to it. We're treated to never-before-seen behind-the scenes photos (including the film's deleted opening sequence with Chris Sarandon in drag), a rehearsal video, and a fascinating array of production memos and other materials. From there, we get roughly 45 minutes devoted to each of the sequels.While they did get many of the surviving cast and crew members to discuss the films, there are quite a few missing people. These include Jenny Agutter, Grace Zabriskie and Greg Germann (part 2), Justin Whalin and Andrew Robinson (part 3), Katherine Heigl (Bride), Billy Boyd, Redman and Hannah Spearritt (Seed), and Maitland McConnell (Curse). I can't exactly fault the filmmakers for not getting everyone on board, but it does make it feel a little less rounded than it could've been.I do have a few criticisms. They included several commentators who had nothing to do with the films, and don't really add anything of significance. At the end of each segment, everyone says how honored they were to be in a Chucky movie, which becomes annoyingly redundant (they could've saved that for the end). And there's not even a passing mention of the comic series, the reboot, or the spinoff TV show (which could probably sustain its own 5-hour documentary). Pretty minor criticisms, with the exception of the latter. Also, it's also a little offputting how Don Mancini and producer David Kirschner credit director Tom Holland for reshaping the original script and hiring Brad Douriff to portray Chucky, but then they bash him for having the audacity to try to take credit for his contributions. Without Holland, the doll would've had no personality, and in an effort to paint him as a control freak, it sorta makes Mancini look like a bigger one. I can't say the doc benefitted from this nearly 40-year-old squabble, which Holland himself barely acknowledged.Currently, this doc's only available to stream on Shudder, but I sincerely hope it gets a home media release, because it deserves to be preserved and seen by all of the franchise's fans. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Chucky.",

With so much footage shot and the studio's unwillingness to expand the length of the released movie's running time, it was decided that a way must be found to maximize the amount of footage that could be used. Because of the wide-screen aspect of the release, it was realized that the multi-panel format could be used most effectively to not only include as much film footage as possible, but to also have concert footage and crowd reaction shots together on the same screen. The filmmakers believed it was important to show the viewing public just what a monumental event the Woodstock festival had unintentionally become. This method also allowed them to show many behind-the-scene activities that reflected all the hard work put in by the production staff and crew, another important detail that the concert's producers thought was very important for the public to see as they always had contended that without the efforts of the entire production staff, this event easily could have degenerated into a disaster.",

Filmmakers Stephen T. Maing and Brett Story provide a strong gripping story with good atmospheres and interesting conversations and explores the characters and lives thoroughly with an open-minded perspective.It was pretty depressing to see workers trying to make the best of their lives but struggling due to the issues they encounter with Amazon and the labor union not being perfect. Especially with recent events with Amazon laying off many employees, it's pretty disheartening to see the struggles and conflicts. The documentary is well-presented with good sound designs, structures and good emotional cores explored throughout.Many of the participants provided honest realities of their situations and remained interest. There are some slow pacing moments I wished could be better but as a whole, it is nice to see pro-union cinema coming back again.",

What angers me even more is the fact that these migrants are actually encouraged to do so. This is a huge political scandal and what does Biden and Harris do? Nothing. They literally pretend nothing is going on at the border and turn a blind eye.James O'Keefe goes to great lengths; causing much risk to himself, to expose what's really going on. Brave and incredibly patriotic. There's no investigative journalist that will push boundaries like James has done. Kudos to O'Keefe and OMG Media.Fantastic documentary.

Ibrahim Nash'at voiceovers his experience of the suffering of the Afghan people and horrors of war (enabled at scale only by foreign machinery) but he has been severely constrained in what he can actually reveal. Some insight into the Afghan purpose is better than none and Nash'at's work is important. I hope he will thrive and be allowed more freedom and access in the future.",

Everyone in the theater with us, including our party of six, left in disgust. We were expecting a faith-based film with research and explanations, engaging for families.Instead, we found a two-hour endless narration of a jumble of two thousand years of history and a warped, repetitive point of view that shows both a lack of knowledge and ability to stick to the subject of the book of Revelation. We found that it seriously offended our Catholic faith, was in total discord with the caring communities fostered here in Mexico, to the point that we now wish we were not so polite as to avoid walking out.This pseudo-documentary doesn't get better, it just repeats and repeats. There are no scenes, just scattered silent people among hideous cartoons and seconds of 'news' mixed with condemnations. There are no facts, no research, just two-thousand years of history twisted and turned to the point where nothing makes sense.Some examples of this rant of demonizations: any post-Trent Council, church-brokered peace in Mexico, the Vatican, Protestants, philosophers, etc., etc., etc. Are simply condemnedWe plan to ask for a full refund, and can easily understand why Cinepolis, after seeing the movie, at first declined it for screening.There are excellent faith-based movies that we have loved - Concepcion last month, Guadalupe, Mirando al Cielo, Cabrini, Fatima, etc. - we see all of them that come to our screens. With this one we have learned to research our choices better. We continue to feel cheated, and duped, with our kindness taken advantage of by people that attack it. I hope this review helps others to choose more wisely.To conclude, I have never seen as many enthusiastic church-goers at a faith-based movie falling asleep and on cell phones in any other theater.",

After listening to the lead \"stars\"/couple, Eddie & Emma, ramble on and on, about nothing really, the documentary completely lost my interest only 8 minutes in. Begrudgingly forcing myself to try to finish watching it and forcing myself to somewhat pay attention to it, the end of the documentary was finally upon me, and I was able to officially, formally validate that in addition to this documentary being amateurish, rambling, boring, and an extremely desperate & very thirsty attempt at grabbing fame and fortune for Eddie & Emma, it was completely pointless and baseless...nothing more than incessant rambling on and on.",

So any notion of liberty has gone aswell.The actual story is about sexual teaching and experimenting, but as it predominantly includes pain and disregarding the partner in some way, it creates internal sexual suppression and retaliation. When the partner retaliates, then they get relief, and the other gets suppressed again.There is some \"method to the madness\" in experiencing pain to break through barriers but this is completely unrelated to this film...Catch Your Dreams (1983) is the best sexually bold \"is it porn? Is it art? Is it a documentary?\" film. People are happy and wildly being themselves.",

In contrast to Dr. Wakefield's insurance carrier, Dr. Walker-Smith's paid for an appeal, and in 2012 the High Court under Justice Mitting cleared Walker-Smith of all charges, concluding that the GMC's ruling had been flawed by \"inadequate and superficial reasoning, and, in a number of instances, a wrong conclusion.\" Mr. Justice Mitting even called for changes in the way the GMC's hearings are conducted, saying \"It would be a misfortune if this were to happen again.\"",

It's also a must-see for those who care about trans rights or enjoy absurd fashion art. The film features memorable scenes of the protagonist facing conflicts in Moscow and Magadan, a town in the remote, far-eastern part of the country. It provides an intimate portrait of Jenna/Gena Marvin during a turbulent period in their life (and in Russia's history): early 2022, at the start of the Ukrainian war.However, it feels like the rapid pace of events caught even the creators off guard, forcing them to complete the movie without delving deeper into the story. Gena is portrayed as a loner, mostly seen arguing with their parents (who insist that Gena abandon their lifestyle). Yet, the footage clearly hints at a network of activists and supporters around them, about whom we learn nothing. Additionally, the film doesn't explore the artist's working methods, artistic philosophy, or personal journey in any meaningful detail. Nor does it reveal how they reached their current position or whether they have any plans or visions for the future of Russia.These shortcomings are especially disappointing because Gena/Jenna is such an awe-inspiring figure. Staying true to oneself is never easy, but when who you are is practically outlawed in your country, it takes extraordinary courage to share it with the world.",

Feldman Ecopark was in the middle of the early days of the unprovoked brutal full-scale war by russia against Ukraine. The name of the documentary will make sense when you watch it.Scattered humorous scenes and reflections after the fact contrast powerfully with the stark terror that the animals and their rescuers experienced. Those moments of relief are needed because the average viewer would probably be overwhelmed otherwise.I'm not sure if I'm an average viewer or not, but I'm crying as I write this a day after I saw it.Slava Ukraini\nGlory to Ukraine!",

Imaginative, fun, insightful for big fans like myself and super well made! Not your standard procedural rock doc, in a good way. The film took a chance by layering a musical, a \"fake\" melodramatic biopic (starring Joe Keery in a hilarious and well played role), concert footage and real interview footage. Steve Malkmus and one of the producers gave a great Q and A after and it was fun to see Steve (seemingly) satisfied with the film! I hope this gets a broader theatrical release or at least a proper online release because it is an inventive, delightfully fresh music film and deserves to be seen!",

In a 2021 New Yorker article by Helen Rosner, she asked Neville \"how on earth he'd found an audio recording of Bourdain reading his own e-mail.\" The article goes on to explain, \"Throughout the film, Neville and his team used stitched-together clips of Bourdain's narration pulled from TV, radio, podcasts, and audiobooks. 'But there were three quotes there I wanted his voice for that there were no recordings of,' Neville explained. So he got in touch with a software company, gave it about a dozen hours of recordings, and, he said, I created an A.I. model of his voice. In a world of computer simulations and deepfakes, a dead man's voice speaking his own words of despair is hardly the most dystopian application of the technology. But the seamlessness of the effect is eerie. 'If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don't know what the other lines are that were spoken by the A.I., and you're not going to know,' Neville said. 'We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.'\" This revelation generated backlash against the movie. WBUR critic Sean Burns wrote, \"When I wrote my review I was not aware that the filmmakers had used an A.I. to deepfake Bourdain's voice for portions of the narration. I feel like this tells you all you need to know about the ethics of the people behind this project.\" Bourdain's widow, Ottavia Busia, announced that she never gave Neville her blessing to use the deepfake simulation of her estranged, now-deceased husband, even though Neville told GQ magazine that she did.",

However when I watched it I was appalled from the beginning, and continued to be until about 2/3rds of the way through when I couldn't continue watching. This movie can hardly be called a documentary because it is NOT educational. Nor is it a documentary about the kink community and BDSM. It is a documentary about a pornography company that films BDSM torture scenes. And from the very beginning you will see the basic rules of safe, sane and consensual being broken by this company. You will watch models have things done to them that they are explicitly saying they DO NOT want done to them. And worst of all you will be forced to watch sexual torture that you do not know you are signing up to watch and makes you feel that your own consent is being violated. This film is nothing more than the filming of the filming of hardcore torture and rape pornography, with some commentary from the pornographers, that again is non-educational in nature, and is just their own personal thoughts and opinions and feelings and such. The movie teaches you absolutely NOTHING about BDSM and Kink Culture, lifestyle or practices. It seems as though its main goal is to shock and appall, which it will for any sensible person who doesn't know that this is not really a documentary, so much as a filming of torture pornography...in which the people are actually being tortured since they aren't even consenting to everything that is being done. This movie is a great disservice to the kink community. Far worse than 50 shades of grey. I never thought I would say this but shame on you James Franco.",

They have taken the theories of Professor Bob Putnam, a relatively obscure political scientist (who I read in grad school), and presented them in a highly accessible way for the general public.Putnam's argument is essentially that America's divisions today are rooted in the decline of our social capital as fewer Americans join clubs and organizations. Whether or not, he has found the true cause of our divisions is debatable. It could also be argued that people join fewer organizations, because they have less free time, because of increased economic inequality. Thus he may be mixing up the cause and the effect. That said, it is an important debate and one that the American public should be more engaged in.I'd also add that the pattern that Putnam is describing is only likely to continue to grow as we turn from in-person networking to online social networks. Online networks can never fully duplicate the relationships that are developed from face-to-face contact. Sadly, I expect the pattern that Putnam describes to continue.The documentary is well worth watching for all those trying to understand the problems in our civic culture today. The film makers have done an excellent job of taking a complex academic debate and making it accessible and available. I hope the film is made widely available for the public and for students reading Putnam in academic settings.",

            "storyline": "Mogwai: If the Stars Had a Sound offers an intimate glimpse into the band's Glasgow roots, creative process, and some of the impact its music has made on its fans.Director Antony Crook paints a picture of Mogwai through archival footage, interviews with collaborators, video confessionals from fans, and fly-on-the-wall footage of the band going about their (sometimes COVID-19-affected) daily lives. The film is bookended by scenes of the recording, production, and release of the band's 2021 album, As The Love Continues.Clever use of (maybe?) a 360-degree camera enables the perspective to wander and explore the setting, before eventually settling on the subject, in a way that neatly fits with the atmospheric, instrumental music.And the music really is the heart of this film. Mogwai's music is played in footage of gigantic live performances, quiet demo sessions, and studio tracks that make up most of the film's score. Songs are given room to breathe, and played almost in full. In Austin's ZACH Theater, it was loud and sounded incredible.Rather than telling you their story, the band lets others do most of the talking. We see collaborators, producers, and musical contemporaries share their experiences with the band, their roles in some of the songs and albums, and the effects that the band has had on them.I was particularly moved by a section that introduces producer Dave Fridmann and Tarbox Road Studios - the film takes the viewer through his incredible discography, sees footage and anecdotes from the band's Come On Die Young sessions with him, and then ties it back together as Fridmann produces As The Love Continues remotely from New York, while the band records in the UK during COVID-19.Footage of Glasgow pops up throughout. Sometimes, lengthy establishing shots can feel like filler in a documentary, but in this case, these shots are almost always accompanied by dialogue or an important music cue - something that keeps things moving.I hope that Mogwai: If the Stars Had a Sound provides a solid entry point for casual fans, and even something for non-fans to connect to and find compelling. But I think it will really resonate with hardcore fans who want new insights, unseen archival footage, and a chance to see this band playing the music they love, loud, and on a giant screen.",

Over the course of seven years, the film captures the community's efforts to enhance living conditions and address the detrimental impacts of pollution.The narrative is driven by the personal stories and insights of Zenica residents, members of Eko Forum, local and federal officials, and representatives from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).As highlighted by the citizens in the film, a significant source of pollution in Zenica stems from the operations of the ArcelorMittal steel plant, which included a coking plant until its closure in April 2024. It's worth noting that the documentary was filmed and finalized prior to this closure, with the information about it being added later.The film sheds light on the troubling dynamics between corrupt governments, European entities, and businesses that prioritize profit over the well-being of ordinary citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The harsh reality is that workers and their families often suffer severe health consequences, including cancer, as a result of this negligence. With no proper monitoring of toxins and a government hesitant to jeopardize investments, the Mayor's comments reveal a troubling compromise: he feels he must cater to both sides, leaving little room for action. The conclusion is stark: the legislators are corrupt. One poignant remark encapsulates the frustration: \"DO THEY THINK WE ARE IDIOTS? WHAT A PERFIDIOUS WAY TO EVADE RESPONSIBILITY!\" Another concerned father aptly stated, \"LET THEM POISON US WHEN WE KEEP QUIET.\"A must watch for everyone...",

Makes you wish you'd been there too.Unfortunately, there's no story here, there's no thread, there's no through-line in the documentary. It's just one interview after another, giving the impression that these are the reels that the doc will be made from. As a result, because there are so many of these moments, you never get to know any one person, you never get to rest on any one particular story. It's just a dizzying array of interview after interview. A shame, because if there had been an attempt to build a narrative, this could have been great.",

Here, in Apocalypse, the documentarist initially admits that she is not an expert on Paul or John of Patmos, and she wisely lets the story be told through the eyes of other figures. Some popular figures here and there get lost in a narrative that would gain more strength from their point of view, as the real highlight is the fearsome pastor Silas Malafaia. Using political terms to comment on your church, and religious terms to comment on democracy, Malafaia walks and rules at Alvorada, to the point of repeating Bolsonaro's speech, so that the president would not forget what he had to say, what Malafaia ordered him to say.Four years of inadmistration are summarized, so that the projection does not become \"look, gringo, how we suffered\", but rather \"look, Brasil, what you went through to get here\", and by \"here\" I mean the real apocalypse.I loved starting the Festival with this film, I would have liked to have enjoyed it more without the pressure of not catching the train to get home (obrigado, meu amor, por ter me ajudado, sem você isso não teria sido possível). Petra Costa, do more! Brazil will never tire of producing material for your filming (only criticism: Cabo Daciolo was missing, who made a cameo at the beginning of the film, back in 2016, and didn't even say \"glória a deux!\").",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. The tagline is \"Artist. Activist. Renegade.\", yet somehow after spending 2.5 hours watching this documentary from Bill Teck, we realize there is even more to Steve Van Zandt. Or maybe you know him as \"Miami Steve\" ... or even \"Little Steven\". Having accomplished so much through various avenues, we are left with nothing but respect for the man.Bruce Springsteen fans know him as Miami Steve of the East Street Band (and Bruce's longtime buddy). Other music lovers know him as the leader of Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul. Some remember him as the driving force behind the \"Sun City\" song and collaboration. Still others know him as an actor playing Tony's consigliere Silvio in \"The Sopranos\", or as a mobster in \"Lilyhammer\". What we learn is that he's also an incredibly talented songwriter, a highly sought-after producer and arranger, and he was the saving grace behind Springsteen's \"Tenth Avenue Freezeout\" on the breakout album. By any name, Van Zandt is not one to stand on his (many) past accomplishments.Documentarian Teck loosely breaks down the timeline of Van Zandt's life and, in keeping with the Disciple title, presents it in three 'Books': Salvation, Revolution, Revelations. Much of the run time is spent in Book I, where we recap the early days of Asbury Park, New Jersey, and local venue, The Stone Pony. Some incredible clips are included showing live performances of Southside Johnny, Van Zandt, and of course, Springsteen. It's also here where we learn the origin of the nickname \"Miami Steve\". It didn't take long for Van Zandt's extraordinary talent as an arranger to shine through, and his ambition and creative forces drove him to leave the E Street Band in 1983 to form his own identity. It's also in this stage where he married Maureen in a ceremony officiated by none other than music icon Little Richard (video), and including singer Percy Sledge.Book II recounts Steven's foray into activism and political activities, namely Apartheid in South Africa. He wrote the song \"Sun City\" and organized the iconic participants of the movement that ultimately contributed to the release of Nelson Mandela. As impressive as his efforts were, and as respected as he was, Van Zandt readily admitted, \"I don't want to be a politician.\"\nAptly named Book III: Evolution took Van Zandt to 1999, where not only did he reconnect with Springsteen and rejoin the E Street Band, he also accepted creator David Chase's offer to take a role in \"The Sopranos\". That's a pretty good year. It's in Book IV: Revelations where Van Zandt originated his popular radio show, \"Little Steven's Underground Garage\", where he keeps rock history alive, and he also brought 1960's band The Rascals to Broadway. In 2021, Van Zandt's memoir, \"Unrequited Infatuations\" was published. Did I mention this isn't a man to sit back and chill?Bill Teck solidifies the admiration Van Zandt has by including interviews with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Southside Johnny, Dion, Gary US Bonds, Mike Stoller, Darlene Love, wife Maureen, Peter Gabriel, Eddie Vedder, Bono, Joan Jett, Jackson Browne, Reuben Blades, Jon Landau, and David Chase. The interviews and clips and photographs are well done, plus he allows Van Zandt to contribute his own thoughts. This is terrific insight, and the film ends perfectly showing Bruce and Steve teaming up for \"No Surrender\".Airing on HBO and streaming on MAX beginning June 22, 2024.",

Launched in July 2022, this $10-billion marvel has been beaming back pictures of stars, nebulae, galaxies, planets, and even a massive black hole. To say that it's the most expensive \"camera\" any filmmaker has ever had the privilege to work with is an understatement. The footage, when viewed on nearly 100-foot-tall screens, becomes truly transporting.Nathaniel Kahn, who not only directed but also wrote and produced the film, shared his insights on what drew him to this extraordinary project. The James Webb Space Telescope is, in his words, a modern-day cathedral. It's a testament to the collaborative efforts of 10,000 individuals from 14 different countries who worked tirelessly for over two decades. Just like the construction of cathedrals in the past, this project was on the verge of being deemed impossible. Kahn beautifully draws a parallel between science and art, highlighting the spiritual and passionate essence that both fields share.What struck me most about \"Deep Sky\" is the emotional impact it carries. The moment when the first images from the telescope are revealed is not just a moment of scientific achievement; it's a moment of awe, relief, and wonder. Scientists who dedicate their lives to such projects often don't live to see the fruits of their labor, and when they do, it's a profound experience. The film captures this beautifully, leaving the audience in a state of wonderment.The James Webb Space Telescope is not your typical optical telescope; it operates in the infrared spectrum, a domain of light that we can't see with our naked eyes. The film brilliantly explains how the telescope interprets this spectrum and translates it into breathtaking visuals. It's not just about looking at the stars; it's about \"sniffing\" the atmospheres of alien worlds, a concept that was once just a dream but has become a reality.Watching \"Deep Sky\" on the colossal IMAX screen brings a whole new level of appreciation for the scale of the universe. In a world where we're accustomed to watching content on small screens, the IMAX experience is a refreshing change. It allows the audience to take in the grandeur of the cosmos, reminding us of our small place in the universe and our unique ability to wonder and ask profound questions.Moreover, this telescope is a testament to human unity and the collective efforts of nations to explore the cosmos. It's a reminder that we are all citizens of the universe, and \"Deep Sky\" couldn't have come at a better time to prompt us to reflect on this. It's a powerful reminder of the human spirit, our capacity for exploration, and our eternal connection to the cosmos.",

This documentary movie truly showed me that Eli Roth cares about the fate of all shark species in the world.Overall, I applaud Eli Roth for making this documentary movies on sharks and he should be very proud of that.",

But on reminiscing on all the bad films I've seen on the festival circuit this year, this one easily comes up on top and therefore merits some warning.'Terrorists' combines shaky digital footage of (not particularly attractive) Thai boys fondling or wanking themselves with shaky digital footage of the 2010 Bangkok protests. What sounds like an interesting (i.e. strange) idea is in fact an extremely obvious attempt to cash in on festival rep. Producer Jürgen Brüning is presenter at and on the board of the International Forum, which is how this film could make it into the program; he also owns Berlin-based gay porn company Cazzo. It's therefore an easy guess that 'Terrorists' combines soft-core footage of a regular porn shoot with newsreel stuff that the crew came up with when the protests happened.What makes this so terrible is less the amateur direction and lack of coherence or background information, but willful distortion of facts mingled with the distinct impression that the filmmakers are not really concerned with the unrest they've seen, but rather try to cash in on it. The stills amply used are actually from the Chinese Cultural Revolution (including a very famous shot of a man hanged with barbed wire while Red Guards force a shoe down his throat); it is implied here that these were actions of the Thai military against communist rebels. Thus pictures of communist violence are being presented as pictures of violence against communists - therefore 'Terrorists' cannot be interpreted as a documentary even in the most generous terms. The idea was probably: 'If Weerasethikul could use stills of rebels in 'Uncle Boonmee', why can't I?' Only that those shots were actually real.In the panel discussion, the director refused to elaborate what the conflict in Thailand was about, claiming that he would not do the (meanwhile defunct) government the honor of explaining who they are. This deepened my suspicion that he was faking his interest in the issue, for if someone makes a film about the situation in his country and gets the chance to present it to a festival audience, it would be logical to explain the situation to people interested in it.Most likely none of this will matter to you, as it would be hard to catch this film anywhere anyway. But in case they're trying to market it on DVD and you find the idea intriguing - don't bother.",

            "storyline": "Timothy Greenfield-Sanders wonderful new documentary, Thinking XXX, was made in conjunction with his new book and art exhibition, where he took two portraits of thirty porn stars, one naked and one clothed, both in the same pose. The portraits were published in a large coffee table size book with essays by pop critics to accompany the pictures. The documentary follows the portrait shoot, and allows the large cast of stars to talk about their experiences and thoughts on the industry. The stars talk from experience, while pop culture critics give their own views of the industry. If you have a negative view of the industry, you might have a change of heart after meeting the top stars of the industry. Moral traditionalists would have you believe the porn industry is a brutal, mob driven industry that attracts only the most anti-social individuals. Well, it certainly has a dark side, as one just has to look at the sad fates of Savannah, Bambi Woods, Shauna Grant, and Lisa Deleeuw. However, the stars featured in Thinking XXX prove it is an industry where an ambitious young person can find success, run a business and not wind up damaged. These people are well spoken, sincere, amiable, normal types who just happen to make a living having sex in front of a camera. Yet they have goals and ambitions just like anyone else. Thinking XXX is amazing in that it challenges our notions of glamor. It pierces the veil of an underground industry to show a silver lining in which these not quite celebrities come across as having more charisma than the biggest Hollywood stars. Thinking XXX has a diverse range of performers. The one common thread linking than seems to be that all his subjects are household names in the porn industry. The two stars who come off as the most interesting are Nina Hartley and Sharon Mitchell, who have some surprising things to say about the business. Hartley and Mitchell came into the business decades ago, and there was much more of a stigma attached to the industry. Mitchell went on to earn a PhD and now runs AIM, which is where adult stars routinely go for medical checkups. Many of today's stars come off markedly different than the older, more experienced performers. Two of today's hottest stars Sunrise Adams and Jesse Jane remark that since they grew up in a generation that was so well versed with porn, they viewed adult stars in the same light as they would a major Hollywood celebrity. That's typical for most people in their age bracket. Sunrise was so ecstatic to have done a sex scene with Jameson that she asked people to \"smell her face\" after her first scene! Jesse Jane does most of her interview naked in a pool. Even by porn standards, this woman just oozes sex and has a body that is almost beyond belief. It's worth mentioning that female stars compromise about 95% of the interview footage for the documentary. We learn from watching the documentary that porn used to be hard for women. For years the industry was run by men for men and so it was understandable that women would feel threatened by porn, but it seems that more and more these days it is an industry where women are coming out on top. Female porn stars are usually much more highly paid than the men and, at the top end of the market, really do call the shots. Female directors becoming more prevalent, and others even setting up their own companies to produce a more female friendly product. To further emphasize this point adult star Chloe is prominently featured. Her success shows how the industry is changing for the better. She is one of the pioneers of the last decade, when women began to direct porn. Chloe is not augmented with breasts implants; she is not blond. There is nothing false about her, which emphasizes the unmistakably authentic orgasms she has in her videos. Chloe is a small woman, nearly flat-chested; her ability to orgasm has made her one of the most famous porn stars in history. This is an incredibly important evolution in porn. Because she is so good at what she does, not because of what she looks like, she is a superstar If you want to take a feminist perspective, you would have to say that things have never looked better for the female adult stars after seeing Thinking XXX. Exploitation does still happen however, but this is no longer the norm. I feel that it is a mark of how society has progressed that women are no longer afraid to embrace their sexuality, and have a great many ways to do so. I find quality porn a turn on and feel that women all over the world also benefit from porn either by profiting from its sale or enjoying an improvement their sex lives, so why not seek to eliminate the bad parts rather than attack the industry as a whole? You can love it, or loathe it but there's no way to deny that in a time in which sex is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our society, the porn industry is influencing our culture just as much as any other form of media is, whether that may be the world of music, television, or film. It's worth mentioning that about the same time this documentary premiered on HBO, I saw in of all places a major grocery style chain an issue of FHM with Tera Patrick on the cover. Patrick was the first adult start to ever grace the cover of a mainstream men's magazine It instantly became their highest selling issue ever. I sincerely hope that FHM's decision to feature Patrick on the cover is only the beginning of mainstream America's embracing the performers shown in Thinking XXX as well as their fellow peers in the industry. They sure deserve it.",

He even throws in a Kobe Bryant helicopter crash joke which changed the whole energy in the audience. He says mean things for shock value, which makes him come across as unlikable.

Isabella Tree and husband Charlie have inherited a country estate that can barely manage to grow weeds. The soil is knackered and desperate action is required. They hit on the fairly radical idea of abandoning the place to nature (except their front lawn!) and the film now follows the reclamation of this space by birds, bugs, deer, pigs, cattle - creatures that would have roamed the land freely a few hundred years ago. They even bring in storks! It's a stunning piece of photography to look at, but the underlying narrative is really quite weak and I found it allowed sentiment to overrule the one thing it fails to address - scalability. They live in a castle with no evident money worries. None that we are told about, anyway. So this looks like a worthy pet project that though laudable and impressive will, as one of their neighbours raises at a meeting, not feed the nation. When the vast majority of these complementary farming techniques were in use, the population of the UK was probably less than 10% of what it is now; malnutrition and starvation were rife and distribution methods, without refrigeration, left the food supply subject to the vagaries of the weather. What this doesn't address in any way is just how this method of nurturing the land is going to provide for an hungry population. It's largely presented by Isabella Tree herself, and she is an engaging individual but one who presents the most complex of arguments in far too simple a fashion - as if it were a lecture on the relative merits of organic methods without addressing in any way their limitations of their practicalities or economics. \"Duncan\" the horse and a few of the pigs have some great fun at a charity polo match and it is a very watchable film - but a little too light and fluffy.",

            "storyline": "I hope I didn't put off some potential viewers for using the term \"long-term (business) documentary\" right away in my headline.Let me assure you, this documentary - basically following three US-based 'new space' start-up companies - isn't boring at all. Some of the main characters in the film are so colorful that you could be fooled into thinking that you watch a fictional movie, not a documentary.A little bit of background first: Ashlee Vance (also heavily involved and briefly featured in the documentary himself) is a business journalist who wrote a book on new space companies and started filming and interviewing executives as well as academics involved in the space and rocket sectors around the same time.(I read his book before watching WWS, but this is not a requirement at all. You may even enjoy more surprises watching it without having read his book first - otherwise a few spoilers are obviously revealed in the book already.)Some readers may be vaguely familiar with Ashlee Vance's name because he was the first to write a biography on Elon Musk - who in turn started one of first private space companies in a Western country (SpaceX).This documentary and his book only feature SpaceX and other pioneering rocket companies started by fellow billionaires and rivals (Jeff Bezos, Paul Allen, Richard Branson etc.) in passing.The main focus of WWS are \"normal\" (they are anything but normal in all other aspects, trust me) entrepreneurs. Ambitious people who followed in the foot-steps of these business moguls and tried to (and are still trying to) launch space ventures thanks to third-party funding. It goes without saying that most of these companies require billions of dollars until they maybe have a chance to break even and stand on their own feet. As is repeatedly said or allured to in the film: \"Space is (very) hard\". This is true both in terms of technology and funding.Speaking of money: Ashlee Vance - having toured the globe visiting space companies in places like New Zealand, French Guiana, Ukraine, Russia and the U. S. - noticed that his funds for the project were running low and started to get outside help to focus/improve the script and finally finish the documentary by 2024.What was once intended as an entire series was cut into one single documentary. His new partners (experienced in the movie sector, eg. Ross Kauffman with an Academy Award for Best Documentary under his belt) in the project also advised him to focus on just a handful of companies.WWS therefore follows three space start-ups in detail, namely Astra, Planet Labs and Rocket Lab (with a particular focus on the CEO of each venture).I think it is a much better movie for it, because there's an emotional attachment for the viewer thanks to this focus. The main characters at each of three companies really spring to life. The completely opposite characters and business approaches of two of the CEOs involved (namely Chris Kemp of Astra and Peter Beck of Rocket Lab) already make the entire documentary worth watching.The movie offers very detailed and generous insights into all three companies. The filmmakers got access to calls with investors and even the rocket launch sequences inside the mission control rooms - including nerve-wrecking setbacks and failures - as well as the IPOs of all three companies on the public stock market.From bedrooms and garage operations with tinkerers - to billions in funding, taking over government launchpads and hiring hundreds of employees. A story of rags to riches. And back to zero in some cases (Space is hard...remember).I can only recall seeing very few business-related documentaries where external observers got such an intimate access over long periods of time (the three companies are covered from about 2016/2017 until early 2024, with older material mixed in from the company archives and other sources).The documentary reveals how the grip on space and rockets has shifted from national states, bureaucratic organizations (like NASA) and their long-term suppliers (often huge companies like Boeing, Lockheed etc.) to ambitious, nimble and energetic start-ups who skirt or even overstep established rules.These tectonic shifts will affect all of us in terms of safety, national security and privacy. The rallying cry behind the movement could be summed up as: Move over, NASA!Satellite constellations already rule our daily life on Earth right now, for better or worse: From GPS positioning in cars and planes, over emergency calls in remote areas with no conventional cell phone average, to more accurate weather forecasts and troop or refugee movements in or ahead of conflicts across the globe.The documentary's title is therefore very fitting indeed, the skies have become a Wild Wild Space. Sort of a \"land grab in space\" in the 21st century. Space is now open for business, not just for a few billionaires or very powerful nation states.The WWS documentary is eye-opening in this regard, we are only at the very beginning. The private space sector today (2024) is maybe at the development stage of the early Internet/WWW era back in 1994 (if I had to take a guess after spending some time on the subject over the last decade).Rating: 8/10 for \"normal\" viewers. Highly recommended, even for people with no particular or prior interest in the space industry. Even 9/10 for audiences interested in space and rockets.One of my minor gripes: Space has no boundaries. It would have been great if the documentary also featured a few space start-ups from Asia or Europe, the movie feels a bit U. S.-centric (with the exception of Rocket Lab and its CEO, originating from New Zealand). Maybe a possible sequel can one day move the spotlight to private space and launch efforts on other continents?",

While this was fine, it left me wanting more depth and detail on the Neanderthals' fascinating world. The human element made it relatable, yet it could have used a bit more focus on the scientific intricacies that could have taken the documentary to a higher level.The topic is incredibly engaging, especially when delving into who came before us and exploring how Neanderthals lived, interacted, and eventually disappeared. Although the documentary touched on many interesting points, expanding the scientific explanations would have added more layers to the narrative, making the experience even more rewarding.Overall, it's a solid documentary, but there is untapped potential to elevate the storytelling by integrating more scientific evidence and theories. Nonetheless, it's a great watch for those intrigued by our ancient predecessors.\"Assuming\"",

Co-directors Tamara Saviano and Paul Whitfield put together a profile of legendary songwriter Clark, but it's also an intimate look at an era, the challenges of the music industry, Clark's enigmatic wife Susanna, and at their friendship with the great Townes Van Zandt.The film is based on Susanna's diaries and the biography written by co-director Saviano entitled, \"Without Getting Killed or Caught: The Life and Music of Guy Clark\". Most documentaries that focus on a musician spend the vast majority of time on the songs, but this is something quite different. Sure, the music is crucial to the story, but this is the saga of struggling artists and poets, and the unconventional and complicated relationships they formed. It's more of a psychological character study than a tribute to the beautiful music.Background on Guy and Susanna go back to each of their childhoods. We see family photos and videos, and learn Guy was brought up west Texas tough, while Susanna had a large family. Brought together by tragedy, their 40+ year relationship was built on art and a free-wheeling nature not uncommon to the times. Guy became best friends with songwriter Townes Van Zandt, and an unconventional triumvirate was the result when Townes and Susanna became spiritual soul mates.Vince Gill, Steve Earle, and Rodney Crowell fill in some details of those early years, and more importantly provide perspective on the commitment to a specific type of songwriting that Guy held precious. There are also clips of interviews with Townes, and we learn just how difficult it was for Guy to achieve success. It came much easier for Susanna, who wrote #1 hit songs AND was an accomplished artist - her painting served as the cover of Willie Nelson's \"Stardust\" album.Of course, Guy Clark ultimately achieved both admiration and success with his songs. Jerry Jeff put him on the map, but Grammy awards came later, as did lifetime achievement awards and best-selling albums. The film includes much of Susanna's time with \"TR\", which is what she called the tape recorder, so we eavesdrop on many conversations - both personal and musical. Clips of Guy's appearances on Austin City Limits in 1977, 1981, and 1989 are a pleasure, but the later years are a bit more difficult. The most challenging part of the story is knowing that Susanna remained bedridden after Townes' death in 1997. Guy passed a few years later: \"Texas is callin', callin' me home.\" With narration from Sissy Spacek (as Susanna), the film is a personal journey that we are privileged to take.",

Moe Tucker also stayed with the band after her return from parental leave and they were joined by a new bassist and keyboardist. This lineup toured the Loaded album around parts of North America and Europe in 1971. A fifth studio album was released for a UK record label under the Velvet Underground name: 1973's Squeeze. All members bar Doug Yule were sent back to the United States in 1972 and Yule recorded all parts except the drums by Deep Purple's Ian Paice, saxophone by someone called Malcolm and some unidentified female backing vocals. Recording the album as essentially a Doug Yule solo effort was at the instruction of manager Steve Seswick, who had earlier brought Yule to the band and had long pushed for the Velvets to adopt a more commercial style with Yule at its centre. Yule himself was displeased at Seswick's control of the process. While Yule had been a significant creative force, albeit secondary to Lou Reed, on the celebrated Loaded album, Squeeze is much-maligned. It received terrible reviews, though it has gained some appreciators over the years. It is typically considered a Velvets record in name only. At around the same time as the official Velvet Underground were being reduced to Seswick's Doug Yule project, Lou Reed, John Cale and Nico had also been in Europe for a reunion performance in Paris in 1972, which was bootlegged and eventually released under the name Le Bataclan '72. Footage from this reunion performance is included in this film.",

They definitely were screwed but the notion that the business would have succeeded if they stayed on is preposterous. It was never going to work. Good intentions I guess but utterly unrealistic dreams. And as an OG subscriber I don't feel ripped off. It was great while it lasted but as they say nothing that good lasts forever.

Including insightful and tender examinations of the routine lives of cowboys and cowgirls in the Argentinian landscapes and environment.With the documentary being more of an hybrid of both documentary and movie presentation, it does have some interesting structures and themes explored.

Particularly when he sings 'Yeah, yeah yeah' and then the band answers, 'No, no, no'. I said, 'Ok. We're in'. And I would play it for the guys and I'd showed them the cover of the album, 'What IS this?' You know, it really, it generated the energy of the whole movie. Yeah I have The Ronettes in there and stuff like that, but the Dolls, when that film was made, was not played in those bars. The film takes place around '63, '64 in reality. But it was something.\"",

If you're not a Blur fan, you're probably not watching this. It follows the band recording and releasing their 2023 album The Ballad of Darren, rehearsing and the celebratory gigs that culminate at Wembley. Shot over the course of a year it's intimate and honest. Well paced and in depth, with plenty of time with Damon, Alex, Graham and Dave. Filmed in part in a very big house in the remote coastal countryside, it has a bohemian air. This is latter-day Blur, gone are the young cheeky lads. There's a weight of expectation now. Especially now in that they're leading up to the biggest gigs of their career, all whilst being less active than ever before. As Dave says \"The less we do, the bigger we get\". They are genuinely interesting people to watch. There's a clear bond, but they are all very different and have had different lives outside the band. It's a lot of people sitting around, smoking in scruffy clothes that probably cost a fortune in barn-like rooms which certainly do cost a fortune. \"I live alone in the countryside and this record feels very much like that\" states Damon and Graham echos \"A boulder had fallen out and there's 40 years worth of stuff in this boulder that's been dislodged\". It's raw and emotional, particularly from Damon who's clearly the driving force. He famously doesn't switch off and this does seem to add some friction to the band dynamic. It works though doesn't it, the songs are wonderful. Speaking of wonderful, Graham is wonderfully dour, moaning about the environment of practice spaces and being \"blinded by stupid lights\". Alex is dramatic and Dave, well Dave is the sensible one as ever. He's the one you can understand, relate to. It's oddly shambolic, but there's tons of depth. They're not afraid to show the process and delve into the past. There's no Britpop focus, what's the point that's story has been told. There is plenty of the origin story told around the rehearsals and the warm up gigs. In Colchester we get 'Popscene' and Eastbourne is treated 'Parklife', it effortlessly makes me want to see them live again. This is much more than the music though. Blur are a band that despite their success have always been oddly undersold as genuine artists. This documentary shows them in their best light, warts and all. Still pushing creatively, emotionally, to the end.",

Finally, the filmmakers agreed to cut some, but not all, of the relevant language, and the MPAA did agree to re-rate the movie PG-13. The PG-13 version does keep intact all the language in the scene that was the main point of contention between the filmmakers and the MPAA, in which a 12-year-old is physically and verbally attacked on his school bus by his classmates.",

Although this is true, it should be added that Breivik was specifically sentenced to containment.

            "storyline": "What if you grew up with a killer doll. For writer and director Kyra Elise Gardner that's exactly what she did.Her father was the makeup artist and head puppeteer who literally helped bring a killer doll named Chucky to life. The titular Chucky has been starring in his own film franchise for over 30 years so Kyra was curious to see how her Dad has been spending his time. Which led her to create this documentary and was also a great excuse to meet the cast and crew involved in the franchise. Like any good documentary it has a purpose. Kyra has grown up hearing about the crew but has never had a chance to meet them. So, she set out to interview all of the key contributors to find out why Chucky means so much to them. Including the film's creators, crew and stars.Initially the film brings you up to speed on the premise of the franchise and then takes you on a blow-by-blow journey through each film. Even though there are massive diminishing returns with the Chucky sequels, I'm always fascinated with how bad films are created. It helps you understand the decisions people made and what they were hoping to achieve. These films have been surrounded with some controversy which I would have liked to see explored more but I can understand the reason for leaving some elements out due to their sensitive nature and the fun tone of the film.You don't necessarily need to be a Horror aficionado to enjoy this doco, although it would definitely help as Horror nuts will lap up all of the backstage secrets and on set stories. If you have an interest in the filmmaking process it offers great insights into the techniques and skills used. Although be warned, if you're more on the squeamish side, there are moments of blood and gore that could be a bit too much for the more discerning viewer.On the whole this is a solid documentary exploring people's fascination and love for the horror genre, in particular, a little doll named Chucky.Nick@WatchItWombat.",

To detractors, she was a \"man-hater,\" to fans she was a feminist icon.The doc covers Hite's troubled childhood, her precarious existence on the fringes of New York's artistic community, her hard work planning and publishing the sex surveys, her sudden rise to fame, jousting with the media and male critics, and her eventual retreat from the limelight. The movie sets the context really well, and uses contemporary film footage, interviews with Hite, personal records and memorabilia, and the testimonies of colleagues and publishers to create a full picture of her ideas and impact. The editing of these different elements into a cohesive story is outstanding.I've never thought much of Dakota Johnson as an actress, and her voicing of Hite's words throughout the movie are typically lifeless. However, I give her props for putting her money and influence behind the making of the film. She was a producer and it must have been hard to pitch. She can be proud of the result, a thoughtful, well edited look at the life and work of a controversial and fascinating woman.",

There are no teams of people wandering around in the dark, freaking out over every thump and shadow. This film shows the raw anxiety and exhaustion of a mother who has never felt like she could speak about the things she sees, and now she's afraid that something bad is trying to take her son. There are no special effects, but things DO happen on camera. If you have patience, it's really worth watching.The use of an XBox Kinect camera to scan for spirits was brilliant. Now I need to find one to add to my kit!",

I was born after Elvis died so this is only the second time I've seen him on the big screen (TTWII was the first which was incredible). If you're a big Elvis fan you won't learn anything new. The frustrating thing for me is that I took friends and Elvis' music wasn't featured as much as it should have been so a missed opportunity there. The documentary seemed a little disjointed in parts and oversimplified the movies era as being a write off and diminishing his creativity as an artist during this period which is wrong. He made some amazing music in the 60s. The visual quality was surprisingly fuzzy so no 4k. We get it with the Colonel already, we know he's evil. But he also did a lot for Elvis which included generating the comeback period starting with the How Great Thou Art sessions. Some of Elvis' best music comes after HGTA and before the special. The documentary also suggests that Elvis didn't do much after the special which was extremely frustrating as he accomplished so much after 1968 and most fans I know prefer the late 60s/ early 70s Elvis era as his voice entered the tenor range.",

And because of this surprise: my favourite actor, Benedict Cumberbatch is a Placebo fan. How awesome is this?The documentary and the whole experience made me love Placebo even more, on a deeper level.Also, a big shout-out to Oscar Sansom - you rock!!!I would highly recommend this documentary to any Placebo fan, but given the themes it explores, I'd suggest it to anyone. It will make you reflect on some truly important matters.It was definitely worth coming from Bucharest for this event!",

Though J. Z. Knight appears early and often as an interviewed expert in the movie, it is not until the end that she is identified as the founder of RSE, and her most controversial aspects (among which are her claim to be able to \"channel\" a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit named Ramtha) are not included at all. Many sources (for example, John Gorenfeld's September 2004 Salon article and Alison Willmore's October 2020 New York magazine article) state that this movie's three directors, William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente, were at the time also followers of Knight and RSE. Mark Vicente later became involved with another prominent cult: NXIVM, the human-potential-development and sex-trafficking pyramid scheme founded by convicted con artist Keith Raniere. After leaving NXIVM, Vicente participated in the exposé documentary series The Vow, revealing many of the cult's damaging tactics; however, nowhere in The Vow does Vicente admit that NXIVM was not his first time adhering to a cult-like group.",

Some are strong on historical detail and others major in the national motivations involved. This documentary is about the real victims: All\nof the inhabitants of Cyprus.The makers have presented sufficient historical information for newcomers to the Cyprus issue to understand where we currently stand without boring them.This is a documentary film charged with emotion using harrowing footage and painful accounts from witnesses that will bring tears from the eyes of the hardest hearted viewers.Where this documentary excels is with the human stories told in accounts from Turkish and Greek Cypriots affected by the conflict. Stories that show the futility of seeking revenge for revenge's sake. Hate begets hate. How demonising the people that you don't know creates ongoing momentum in the continuation of hatred and bigotry. It shows the brave people that are making great efforts to collaborate in the search for missing persons and bring healing for their families. We witness dialogue between those who admit that both sides have caused pain for each other and want to begin building healing bridges between them.A really excellent piece of filmmaking from Director Cey Sesigüzel and Producer Andreas Tokkallos.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. Art, sex, drugs, rebellion, counterculture, and even death ... that's the infamous history of New York's Chelsea Hotel. And for the last decade, it's been about renovation and ongoing construction, and the persistence of a few long-time residents. Co-directors Maya Duverdier and Amelie van Elmbt deliver an unconventional documentary in that it doesn't focus on the Chelsea's iconic place in NYC history. It doesn't focus on the idols who created art here. In fact, the history of the place takes a backseat to the current residents and the never-ending construction, neither of which are as entertaining as the legendary past.In a tease, the film opens with a young Patti Smith waxing poetic about what Dylan Thomas might have glimpsed from the same rooftop. This is followed by a montage featuring the instantly recognizable faces of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Leonard Cohen (\"Chelsea Hotel #2), Marilyn Monroe, Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, Arthur C Clark, and Salvador Dali, amongst others. That gives you some idea of the place the building holds in the history of art. We then cut to the elderly residents trudging through hallways that are covered in plastic and littered with wires. Some chat it up with the construction workers, while others seem oblivious to the inconveniences - likely just resigned to the daily obstacles.Most tenants took the buyout offer from the new owners, while others cling with all their might to the low-rent (both definitions) living they've grown accustomed to. The Christmas tree in the lobby may or may not indicate the season, and mostly we realize the misery in trying to live one's daily life amidst the constant accompaniment of hammering, drilling, and sawing. This is more a Sociological case study on gentrification than anything else, despite the filmmakers attempts to tie in the past by projecting the famous faces on the walls.The closest comparison to Hotel Chelsea is Los Angeles' equally infamous Chateau Marmont. A 2008 documentary entitled, CHELSEA ON THE ROCKS, provides an interesting look at Chelsea's historical relevance in the art world, something co-directors Duverdier and van Elmbt seem to care little about. There are two approaches to the Hotel Chelsea that might hold our interest: the past or the future. Unfortunately, this look at the present merely scratches something that doesn't itch.Opening in theaters and On Demand beginning July 8, 2022.",

But I was very put off by the early statement in this film that \"everyone knew.\" Everyone did not know. That is generally how these things go. In addition, the film maker seems to have belonged to a particularly toxic sort of sub-group -- a commune in Holland where children were sent sexy notes by adult men. She seems to extrapolate from this that all men were doing this to all children, which is patently not the case. There were very many deeply decent men and women in the community who would have been appalled to know such things were going on. The woman at the end, who underwent sexual abuse from Rajneesh seems to have rehearsed her outrage a bit too carefully. On the other hand, I thought they did an excellent job of getting Ma Anand Sheela on the record saying that children being sexually abused was their own choice.",

It should have been thrown out with the trash not put into a care home, how much did that cost the family? Did the care home know what he had done?The mother said as they were going thou the clothes \"we need to laugh\" because she knows she is guilty. She was abused why would she ever go anywhere near her parents again? I know it's easy to say \"it's her parents\" it's not that easy to walk away. But she left her daughter alone in the house\nThe grandmother was as bad as IT in my opinion she knew what was going on, but done F ALL\nand then we have the religion BS, it's like the Mafia kill 10 people then pop to Church\nThe old C@@T was not even sorry, in his sick F up mind. It's all good cause Jesus will forgive me\nAs for forgetting I can't comment on that, but i suppose to be able to live your life can you forget? Some people can put bad things that happen to you away deep in your heart behind a padlock, but it still affects them\nA lot of people are saying Amanda was wrong to make this film, what I got from it, she is angry with her mother more then the Monster as her mother could have got him arrested and she done zero and made it worse, this doc was not just about the Monster IT but also to hurt the mother.As for the other victims, you can't force someone to appear on TV and the one with the daughter who was preggers seemed fine being on the program\nWe all want to look up to our parents and be proud of them and make them proud of us.Sometimes you have to admit who they really are and let the world know.",

This makes for a highly entertaining film that captures Nastase's charm, but also falls short in structural coherence and depth, leaving many potentially interesting aspects of his life unexplored. The early years are notably absent, offering only a glimpse into his fiery nature and leaving most of the root causes to the viewer's imagination.The documentary, while touching lightly on the political and social context of the late 20th century, focuses more on reminiscing about an era of professional tennis that is gone now - one marked by a closer, more informal camaraderie and stronger personalities. Nastase might be seen as intolerable today but was a product of his times, contributing to the sport's transformation. Or maybe just witnessing it. The narrative conveys warmth and nostalgia through testimonials, past and present, from tennis legends like Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King, who reflect on Nastase's complex personality with a mix of admiration and bemusement.Despite its engaging content and archival footage, the film struggles with pacing and clarity, often feeling like a fragmented collection of anecdotes about Nastase's talent and temperament. It veers towards impermanence and is afraid to look deeper into his legacy and how aging and leaving the limelight has affected such a complicated personality.Nevertheless, the documentary succeeds in capturing the essence of Nastase's flamboyant character, making it a compelling watch for those interested in the history of tennis. And for those longing for \"the good old days\".",

This is the first hour of the documentary.The last half hour is then how he's clearly not sorry enough. How they don't approve of his act and how he doesn't bring sexual misconduct into their act.It feels like they are demanding he make their trauma part of his comedy routine and it's hard to imagine they wouldn't be complaining if he had.The only interviews that the documentary crew produced are unabashedly aligned with the agenda of documentary. They didn't attempt to present any counter opinion by anyone in the industry, just various footage clips that were narrated around.",

            "storyline": "Saw this at the Movies That Matter 2024 filmfestival in The Hague. Lots of issues pass by in this story. Women who return after having lived years under ISIS are not always accepted by their original society, for two reasons. (1) They are generally converted (forcefully, but still) to Islam, something in their (Yazidi) beliefs you cannot simply shake off. (2) Children who came forth from their life within ISIS, are separated from their natural mother and she cannot keep them with her. Such obstacles result in alienating these women from their hometown and their own people, depriving them from a useful future. What are these women to do??Apart from that, when trying to get these women back, it proves very difficult to find them. They usually receive new names, thereby destroying all traces back to their original life. Also, they are often sold more than once, so following their tracks is far from trivial. So-called rescuers are needed as an intermediary. We see part of this demonstrated when searching for Mediha's lost brother. Eventually they find him in Turkey, where his current \"parents\" are willing to give him away when granted amnesty for their ISIS misdeeds. His return is not easy for him, however, as he seriously misses his \"mother\". He weeps all day long while suffering homesickness. For him, this homecoming, albeit happy for the family wanting him back, works out as a stressful event. Understandably, he cannot see the big picture and cannot realize this new family is his actual natural family. Moreover, he must unlearn Turkish too, an extra complication in communicating with him.Another angle is prosecuting the ISIS-men who stole these women from their home in the first place, forcing them into slavery, and even selling them to other men within ISIS. Some numbers were reported about cases where it was possible to identify the men in question. Alas, it was a disappointingly low number (say a handful in total). In other words, another avenue without success.Finally, the women in question usually don't talk freely about their experiences, mostly due to commonly untreated and ignored PTSS. The main protagonist in this movie was relatively unique, being able to speak about what happened, in fact a rare example. She was able to pinpoint her captor within a long series of photos shown to her, a tedious session but it had to be done as starting point for the search. Not all women can endure this, without getting overwhelmed by emotions or PTSS.All in all, a solid and multi-facetted overview to demonstrate the difficulties in this field. Undoing the wrongs involved, is met with very many obstacles, not alone for practical reasons but also because of cultural and religious principles. The movie's urgent message shows clearly that solutions are far away.",

The boxing career highlights were so severely cut short, I feel the director could have dedicated one episode to boxing, one to his transition into politics and a third on the current conflict.Just like Klitschko's fight with Lennox Lewis, this one was brought to an end prematurely.",

Grace had just landed here from South America, a notoriously unsafe place where she encountered no problems, and then it was little old \"safe\" New Zealand that got her. It's incredibly sad.Most documentaries have to have someone in the present explaining everything that happened at the time of the case. This documentary doesn't have to do that at all. There is so much CCTV footage, interview footage and court footage that it comfortably fills the run time. And all of it is fascinating.The CCTV footage being matched up with his interview footage to show how he was lying was very well edited. And the courtroom footage showing the defense attorneys hating every minute of their life, having to say the things they were being paid to say was fascinating to watch.It's all pretty upsetting and dark stuff. Be aware that this is not a light watch. It is a well made documentary though. 9/10.",

With excess static cuts.Joseph Paris wants to make a personal trip, a revealing trip. Yet the final product says nothing about his discoveries. Naked War gives a stale taste at the end. The film feels like someone who felt sorry for wasting a year. The ends do not meet. But that someone has to bring out something one can sell. There is no trend: where do they come from, where do they go to? Yet, this is quite long for a snapshot. What is shown as a personal trip ends up very impersonal.And all this comes in contrast with what Femen stands for. Femen has the courage to go forward knowing they are going to be beaten and insulted. Joseph Paris barely has the guts to show a couple of out of focus faces for the brutes hitting. There is no trace of context. The outside world is two people talking in empty rooms.I am sad for these second rate film makers getting involved with Femen and their fight. I hope \"there is no such thing as bad publicity\" holds for these women.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",

As a result of this mistake, even after months of work by experts, the 20 hours of footage couldn't be synchronized with the audio tracks. The choir director from the Watts recordings was brought in to try to lip-read the reels, but after months of work, only about 150 minutes of footage had been matched with sound, none of it adding up to a complete, useable song. Deadlines passed as the \"Amazing Grace\" album came out in June 1972, selling millions with no synergy. In August, Warner Bros. officially wrote off and shelved the movie. Pollack never gave up on the project, but constantly had other commitments. In 2007, dying of cancer, Pollack finally handed the documentary project over to producer and music enthusiast Alan Elliott.",

It changed everything for me and gave me confidence and understanding about my feelings that I never had. I wish someone would have told me this 30 years ago.

Yekaterinburg is the closest city, which is 340 miles to the south; and the closest town like 60 miles away. Seven of the nine hikers were college students with the other man a healthy veteran of WW2, fifteen years their senior. They left behind undeveloped film and diaries up until the day of their deaths for evidence of what went down, not to mention their grisly remains and the autopsies thereof.While Le Guillou wisely leaves the mystery open at the end, he also doesn't fail to point out what he thinks likely went down with the help of various experts and investigators, Russian and American. Certain popular theories, including the outlandish ones, are ruled out for one good reason or another, which leaves the most obvious scenario, according to Liam and his experts. Simply put, they believe the hikers were murdered, possibly by a savage band of Khanty living in the area, who wouldn't take kindly to Soviet invaders, especially if they inadvertently marred one of their shrines.While this theory is interesting, there wasn't any evidence at the scene of these supposed assailants, like footprints. The better theory is that 3 feet of shifting snow during the snowstorm suddenly fell on the tent at night, which panicked the nine inhabitants. Fearful of an actual avalanche, they cut themselves out of the tent and fled without proper attire. When they realized an avalanche wasn't going to happen, some tried to make it back to the tent but died of hypothermia in the -13 degrees Fahrenheit weather (it was no doubt difficult to find the camp in those conditions). What happened to the others is well explained in an 11-minute documentary called \"Is Dyatlov Pass Mystery Finally Solved,\" available for free on Youtube.This film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes.GRADE: B-",

You won't protect what you don't love, and you can't love what you're unaware about.The film shows beautifully what goes on so close to our homes, but it fails to convey how we as humans are so dependant on nature. The director could've taken a firmer stance on nature protection and (extensive) fishing.Direction/editing is a bit all over the place and I found it hard to find a clear syoryline. But the weakest point is the narration, also done by the director/cinematographer. It does not feel sincere or natural, and I often found myself mentally transported to the sound recording booth. Voice acting is quite the skill and a voice actor would've been a better choice I think.The introduction felt out of place, although being nicely produced. It did serve as a decent introduction to the (somewhat) thematic Cousteau quotes (that kind of served as chapters?)Despite its flaws, this is definitely a movie I highly recommend to see (in theaters if possible).",

Yes. Is it for the usual reasons? Not in this lifetime.

            "storyline": "Dan Savage has been questioning monogamy for years now, trying to apply the gay standard where it doesn't belong. Citing exceptions doesn't build a case for the norm, elites can indulge in behaviors which the masses cannot survive. Insulated by wealth and high iq, they are not examples to follow. You hear the examples of the exceptions, the inuit, harsh environments necessitating extraordinary compromises simply to ensure survival in order to make more general claims against evolutionary psychology when it doesn't follow.You see the sex at dawn author brought in uncritically as always, the internet phd who's book is based on the absurd idea that before agriculture there was no jealousy. This is the guy who built a career on misunderstanding the meaning of Bonobo's, a dead end species which doomed itself when the metric for female selection became choosing males they could dominate, and so they became both dumb and small, only existing due to splendid isolation, and protection by humans.The idea that license leads to happiness has been tested by decades of lifting of social controls and repression. The actual results were broken families, record anti depressant use, and wide spread sterility. There is plenty to explore on this topic but Savage's politics prevent him from exploring anything beyond the usual leftist talking points, always asking about the consequences up to the point of their own favored policies. Things like attacking the social policy of pressuring marriage to prevent single motherhood, never asking what happens when government enables the opposite. What are the dysgenic consequences, government policy is selective breeding of your population whether you wish to admit this or not, this is what is actually happening, Savage can't even begin to touch on problems like this, and so the film has no value.Let me put it another way, we have rules against cheating in other areas, such as cheating on your taxes. Does the fact that enforcement of the ideal is never perfect justify the opposite of total transgression? of course not.Its funny watching this now as it was part of the poly push, an attempt to \"question\" and then normalize certain alternative life styles, a few years later some of its proponents have admitted that it was always fraudulent, the failure was inevitable, little more than monkey branching in plain sight. Topics like these are presented as if they were exploring something new, when its very far from the case, such arrangements have been tried as recently as the 60s with communes, this is the problem when a documentary just ask questions it doesn't want answered.",

            "storyline": "An unique documentary that reconstructs for the first time the Nazari Society of Granada of 14th century Andalusia. The Builders of the Alhambra tells the story of the historic construction of the Alhambra in Granada from the point of view of Ibn al-Khatib, recreating the social, cultural and economic context of Granada in the 14th century. The film interweaves the current vision of the Alhambra in Granada with scenes recreated in space and time (1340) to discover the characters responsible for the construction of the palaces of the Alhambra, their history and the reasons that led them to build it.Knowing that his besieged Kingdom of Granada is doomed to disappear due to the advance of the neighboring Christian kingdoms, Yusf I, the Sultan of Granada, embarks on the construction of a building that reflects the splendor of his civilization and defies oblivion: The Alhambra of Granada. His vizier, Ibn al-Khatib (Amr Waked), a poet and genius ahead of his time, who was even compared to Machiavelli and he participated in this colossal challenge. When the sultan's son, Mohammed V, inherits the throne and involves him in the new policies of his reign, the vizier is torn between the ideas of his old world and the new one that is emerging. His chronicles tell us the story of 14th century Granada, the swan song of Muslim Europe.The documentary provides a broad biographical reference of Ibn al-Kathib. After his father and older brother were killed in the Battle of Río Salado (Christian troops commanded by king Alfonso XI) in 1340 , Ibn al-Khatib was hired to work as a secretary for his former teacher Ibn al-Jayyab, vizier to Emir Yusuf I. Following Ibn al-Jayyab's early death from the plague, Ibn al-Khatib became vizier and head of the emiri chancery, serving also in diplomatic roles in the courts of Andalusi and Maghrebi rulers. He was poet, builder and essay writer and while savouring the wisdom of Sufism, in which repeated prayers bring one closer to God. His poetry was influenced by court poets from the Mashreq, or Islamic east. In his treatise about the plague he explores the idea of transmission of disease through contagion, centuries before Louis Pasteur conducted his experiments in Europe. The original Arabic text is preserved in the Zaydani Collection at the Biblioteca del Real Monasterio de El Escorial. Of the estimated deaths due to the outbreak of bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, that swept through al-Andalus in the 14th century, the numbers range to as high as a third of the Muslim population worldwide. For much of his life he was vizier at the court of the Sultan of Granada, Muhammed V and where he created a hospital. He spent two periods in exile in the Marinid empire; (he resided variously at Ceuta, Tlemcen and Fes). In 1374, he was imprisoned for 'Zandaqa (heresy). He was sentenced to death by suffocation. Earlier and modern historians have speculated that his many private and political feuds with the Emirs of Granada belonging to the Nasrid dynasty were probably the main factors in his treatment and execution. His body was burned before being buried at Bab Mahruq, a city gate in Fes.There is also a long reference to 'Al Andalus' where all the knowledge of antiquity was gathered and translated, including that of the wise men Euclid, Ptolemy, and Avicenna. There many knowledges were developed, including medicine, Arabic caligraphy, epigraphic decoration, and other knowledge such as astronomy -detailing lunar and Venusian views early on-, astrology and even the zodiac.And of course, remembering the Alhambra in Granada with its Comares Tower, the wonderful ceilings and the Generalife gardens with their prosperous orchards. In fact, the various fruits that came from Arab orchards that spread throughout the world are praised , creating an authentic Green Revolution.The cast of mostly unknown actors is led by the actor who plays Ibn al-Khatib, Amr Waked, known for films such as \"Syriana,\" \"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\" and \"Lucy.\" This Spanish documentary film was professionally directed and produced by Spanish film director Isabel Fernández and released on November 25, 2022.",

There is nothing wrong with the first part. I can not say the same thing for the swinging scenes.This movie would be more watchable If nudity and sex scenes were realistic and explicit,Dark scenes and censorship were kllled the movie. I hope director of the movie.take seriously this case and do not make same mistakes next time:",

It includes the history of the 6 adopted kids, the women who adopted them and the mistreatment these kids endured.Unfortunately, this story will be seized upon in a 'we told you so' manner and I write this review in counter to the other review by jfnaoau who portrays the family in a racist and homophobic way. These were great kids whose lives began and ended in unfortunate circumstances. These were 2 women who purposely misled the public and had terrible parenting skills. The race or family makeup makes no difference to what happened to this family. Fortunately the documentary does not try to paint this family unit in a negative light but focuses on the behavior of each individual. This is an American tragedy enhanced by the failures of the court and Child Protective Services.",

Her 'connection' to this sick sadistic killer and visiting him while pregnant? Then talking to him while in labor, sending pictures of her SON and asking him to be an honorary uncle? OMG this woman should be ASHAMED of herself, but instead she is proud of putting her goals before her son. Look how empathetic and non-judgemental I am!!!! Can you imagine sending your kid's picture to a serial killer and ask him to be his her uncle? She never once condemns a man who tortured young girls with items from a tool box in the worst way imaginable, let that sink in. His murders were so horrific the investigator killed himself over it. She actually buys into his remorse when he's dying as something other than self-pity and manipulation. And she states she was sad when he died because he was an authentic friend? God I hope no one in law enforcement employs this woman.

These guys were huge when I was a kid and their story is one that can never happen again. A comedy act opening for the Rolling Stones in front of 20,000 people? They had some magic and this movie captured a lot of it. Such a cool story told of these guys. It was a really fun movie that flowed well beginning to end.",

However, like with many \"cult\" documentaries that are in vogue, it ends with lazy tabloid \"this could happen to anyone\" scaremongering instead of doing the investigative journalism to expose the common threads that left the victims they interviewed more susceptible to falling prey to this type of brainwashing. In this case, the documentary could have explored our dismal sex education for women in particular, our cultural shaming of female sexuality, our epidemic of child sexual abuse in all sexes, and our failure to teach both trauma recovery and critical thinking skills. Some friends and I attended an introductory One Taste lecture describing the \"Om\" meditation in the late 2000's and because I had expert knowledge of my sexual response from a young age from women's health books and had training in critical thinking skills, I immediately recognized the cult tactics of groupthink and gaslighting--and I saw the glazed look in the women's eyes who were devotees. It was truly creepy.Documentaries on cults should examine how our culture at large grooms people to be vulnerable. But every time we try to have that conversation, it's seen as \"victim blaming\" rather than what it really is...empowering to avoid victimization. Documentaries like this have a responsibility to look at the bigger picture, instead of just creating more fear about how any of us could be next which, in my experience, is not true.",

It does however manage to document the origin story of one of the greatest PC games ever made, with its chapter structure, a kudos to the game's own structure, easy to follow.What makes it in some way stick beyond just a YT video is the time warp enjoyed with all the protagonists telling their stories, which are usually interesting details from the production process. The odd personal moments elevate what we're watching and I was left wishing there had been more of them.Its limited scope doesn't allow the Anniversary Doc to shine, but it did leave me with a nostalgic craving.

            "storyline": "The clever title places the responsibility for lying on the subject who is defrauded, as a statement of the way in which it is easy to lie because others allow themselves to be lied to. This idea is represented in the last part of the film when, after numerous arrests and some murders related to the OneCoin scam, the rebirth of the company continues to attract investors who have even lived through that entire chaotic process. This is the main topic of a documentary that manages to clarify some basic concepts, such as what the hell a blockchain is, but that becomes unbalanced in an execution in which it doesn't seem to be clear whether to take the matter as a joke or seriously. Too many times the director uses film clips and archive images as visual support, such as when a situation similar to a spy movie is referenced with an image of James Bond. But these resources are not only unnecessary, they don't contribute to the effectiveness of the moments when he wants to get serious.",

It will give you a flavor of agrarian life, from business deals to friends ad family gatherings, its presence is an quintessential feature..It is sweet as it uses more than 51% corn, it is all natural with no additives and a stringent distillation proof is followed in making it including entry and fill proof. It is stored in white oak barrels which is a lead character of bourbon. These barrels are sometimes made from 30+ different oak trees that are often aged 100 years! Tgey are then charred that makes a clear white dog to a beautiful vibrant golden bourbon at the end of its aging which could be 10, 20 or 30 years ... if you open a 20 years aged bourbon, make sure you drink with your loved ones and finish it.

And then in terms of the actual archive, the process, it wasn't like we collected everything and then we cut the movie.\nIt was ongoing throughout the entire process. And we had heard that there was this fabled footage that existed from the Club Fantastic tour. And I don't think we found that until like a couple of weeks before we finished. It was something that somebody knew someone who knew someone who had a copy of VHS tape on their shelf.\nIt's much more happenstance than I think people would assume. I think that people would assume that this all exists in one centralized location in George Michael's estate. Andrew had a lot of it, but there were a lot of things that were just sort of floating out there that we were fortunately able to find and pull in.\"",

But then it lightens up, but differently. Because this time, when it goes back to silly... it is silly, sharp, profound, and real all at the same time and you learn something about yourself. I admit it; I laughed, and I cried. Just like her TV show, at the end you realize she knew where this was going the whole time and led you to a very satisfying awakening.",

The highlight being one in Berlin, where she lived just before she went back home to Toronto to make the album. It's a ride! I had forgotten the hair-costumes but that showed me a bit of how much influence she has had because on Doja Cat tour, earlier this year, I saw nearly an copycat of that outfit in an Youtube video. It's a flashback to a time where she was shock-punkrock, that is much wider today. She said that she walked on audiences on all the performances and it's beautiful that a 56 year old icon does not give AF. That image is so like Iggy Pop.",

But this new film was not all that different from the first one which made it a bit of a disappointment. This new movie covered the back-stories of Josh and Ryan which was done in the first film, but now done again in a more updated manner. it also covers the reasons for minimalism again addressed in the first movie. If you saw the first movie, you already knew all of this.What it adds is new testimony from several people who adopted this lifestyle. They range from 17 to 67. However, there was not enough there to really get into why these people did it, how they did it and the outcome. It was too brief. The movie is not even a hour long so more could have been added. I would have liked to have heard more from the 67 year old baby boomer since that demographic would seem far less likely to embrace this kind of lifestyle change. That could have been a really fascinating part of the movie that built on the first film where the message was preached on a long road trip across the USA. Also, how many people adopted this philosophy but gave up on it? Some people like their stuff and its not clogging up their lives. That would have been interesting to see. I would have also like to hear Josh and Ryan talk about their homes far more. You see Ryan's but not much is said about it. How about interviews with both of their wives? They are both shown but say nothing? Are they onboard with the lifestyle.The movie also has commentary by \"experts\". There is the anti-capitalist woman from Greenpeace who blames consumerism on capitalism. Not exactly true. Capitalism has been in this nation since before its founding and this consumer consumption mania is a far more recent trend - maybe about the last two generations only. What is the cause of this trend that some in recent generations need to find fulfillment in stuff rather than faith, relationships, family, pursuit of knowledge, work, etc? That was not addressed very well. The WWII generation and the early baby boomers were far less consumer oriented due to what they experienced growing up. They were frugal. So what changed in the country? It cannot just be attributed to advertising and capitalism. Something else is at work here that is driving it. They also have Dave Ramsey in several short segments where he is more focused on avoiding debt rather than promoting minimalism. Dave Ramsey is anything but a minimalist. I watch his show. He is great on personal finance advice. He also claims he owns $300 million in paid-for real estate, has a very successful multi-million dollar business, a numerous cars and collections, and multiple homes. So why pick him to talk to? They also mention that people buy things mainly to impress others. That is a big overgeneralization. Not everyone does that. People buy things because they enjoy them and are not trying to show off at all.I was really hoping for a lot more in this new movie. But if it is your first view of the Minimalists, then it is all new. Hope the guys do another that really builds on this. They are good presenters. Also, this film made by Matt D'Avella shows that independent film makers can do work that rivals the corporate media. Very nicely filmed.",

They are at times very emotional, but always with a sense of honesty. They were mostly people (around my age, as far as I can tell) who were having a good time being ski bums, when tragedy struck. How they dealt with the tragedy is the main thrust of the story, and it is told with brutal forthrightness.Even if skiing or winter recreation isn't your thing, this is still a movie to watch.",

Most notable amongst these arguments is that unlike other psychological disorders, DID is not observed outside of treatment with certain select clinicians, all of whom already believe in DID. What has been observed across all clinicians and researchers, however, are examples of confirmation bias, persuasive interview techniques, demand characteristics, and the oftentimes overwhelming urge to please demonstrated by patients in general. In addition, early North American works (DID is an overwhelmingly American disorder, yet another point of contention for the pro/anti-DID debate) which are seen as having started the DID diagnosis trend have been debunked in recent years as primarily fictitious stories, written to sell books. As controversial as the diagnosis of DID is, many feel that there may be some degree of negligence on the part of the producer(s), the director, and the film company as a whole for not employing a disclaimer as well as affording equal time to opposing expert viewpoints.",

Outlawed in 1808, it continued in secret. The last ship to bring kidnapped Africans to the United States was the Clotilda, which docked in Mobile, Alabama, before getting sunk to hide its violation of the ban on slave-trading.Margaret Brown's \"Descendant\" focuses on this, as well as the descendants of the enslaved people on the Alabama coast. It's a fascinating look at the aftermath of slavery, and how the descendants of the slaveowners are the biggest landholders in the area. Not to mention the chemical refineries dumping all sorts of toxins.This is not a documentary that you'll forget anytime soon. I recommend it.",

If somebody operates with love, and they can communicate their truth while accepting others truth, then they are like God, and they are one of gods people. Unfortunately, at least 2 of main narrators in this film are very much filled with hate, they are men of distraction and distortion.I personally am a believer in the flood, and I don't think that the Bible is a terrible account of it either. But trying to prove facts that have been distorted over thousands of years isn't helping their case.Given many other accounts which have surfaced, a better interpretation of the Bible in particular of the flood or that God in the Bible is aliens, you can quite literally replace the word God in the Bible with aliens and have a much more accurate account. They spend a lot of time talking about the lifespans of humans, well that's what happens when you have a race that lives 1000 years and they interbreed with a genetic stock here that lives much less time.There's no mention of carbon 14 dating, and it's quite a sad charade of trying to make a literal interpretation of the Bible seem plausible by pretending that the only arguments are the ones that they can attack.Overall, I enjoyed this film and watched it twice, I pray that the authors hear find love in their hearts as Jesus wants them to.",

That's just the way people expect it. Now imagine what it was like in 1968?? It was absolutely expected that Jane would give up her career to have a child. Well guess what? Jane does NOT give up her career to have a child, and it's one of, I think, the most powerful moments in the film for audience members, particularly of a certain age and of a certain generation and a certain gender, where it's actually a heroic thing. I've found that one of the biggest challenges in being an artist is trying to be a great artist and a great parent. It's impossible. You can be one or the other. You have to pick. Because they both TAKE TIME, and there's only so many hours in the day. So that narrative, to me, was very intriguing.\"",

REVIVAL69: THE CONCERT THAT ROCKED THE WORLD by Ron Chapman is a documentary about how the entire concert was put together.Chapman was able to get on camera interviews with several of the participants including the show's organizers. Originally, it was mainly conceived as an oldies show bringing together Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley and Gene Vincent. The then little known Alice Cooper band was recruited to be both a 'new' act as well as serving as Vincent's backup band. When ticket sales flagged, they paid The Doors to be the headliners. When that didn't move the needle much, they hatched a last minute scheme to get John Lennon to be an MC. Seemingly on a whim, Lennon not only agreed to appear but brought along his wife Yoko and friends (including Eric Clapton) to debut The Plastic Ono Band. It was such a hurried plan that Lennon and his entourage didn't land in Canada until after the show had already begun. The promoters hired a local Biker gang to escort Lennon from the airport and help with the logistics at the venue (fortunately, it worked out better than the Rolling Stones and Altamont!).Director D. A. Pennebaker (MONTEREY POP) filmed the show and Chapman uses that footage generously throughout. Pennebaker released his own short documentary as SWEET TORONTO* in 1971. The footage shows that it was more than just the John Lennon show. The other artists put on lively sets, in particular Cooper. This is the show where the legend that Cooper bit the head off a chicken was spawned (the reality was more along the lines of the 'Turkey Drop' episode of WKRP In Cincinnati!). L. A. Scenesters Kim Fowley and Rodney Bingenheimer were hired to be the hosts and Fowley is partly credited helping with create the cigarette lighter encore tradition at rock concerts. Unfortunately, The Doors refused to be filmed so there is only scattered footage of the band.It's a well put together Documentary with some interesting interviews with performers Cooper, Klaus Voorman and Robby Kreiger as well as attendees Geddy Lee and critic Robert Christgau. As usual, one wishes to have seen and heard more music. Fortunately, in addition to SWEET TORONTO, more of Pennebaker's footage exists online and on various home video releases. REVIVAL69 is a fascinating tale of Canada's most famous rock fest.On DVD the Doc is better known as JOHN LENNON AND THE PLASTIC ONO BAND: LIVE IN TORONTO.",

It takes a lot of people, who sacrifice their lives to let the Taiwanese people to enjoy the freedom now.By looking at Chinese Communist nailed down Hong Kong democracy in 2017, most of Taiwanese people stand up with free world to fight against possible invasion from China. If we lose Taiwan and it's democracy, free countries such as Japan, South Korea, Philippine, etc. Will be forced to defend their own country, sames as America.The chips manufacturing including AI in Taiwan will be destroyed or controlled by Communist, which is totally authoritarian region, very corrupted, and have killed many millions of their own people.This film will give you a better understanding about what the world is happening now.

The documentary explores about AI being used to create avatars and how AI can become the product of something and as a whole, the documentary does explore some insightful discussions and conversations but while also leaving more to be desired.The production is good and the sound design is solid. The participants provide some really good discussions about family loss, AI creation, and the future of technology as it helps to understand both contexts on each side. However, when watching this documentary, it does feel more frustrating rather than interested because the discussions about how advanced AI has become really makes me feel uncomfortable. The idea that capitalism and AI is making money off of grieving people and exploiting families is disgusting and it's really sad to see how AI is developing while also causing problems on people. I am not sure if the intentions were to be amazed because if that was, it failed.I do appreciate that the documentary shows both sides of the argument but the structure feels a little uneven and a little too focused on the style over substance feel. There are some interesting musical and editing choices. Overall, it's an interesting documentary to explore but there is a lot more left to be desired.",

It describes the massive rise in religious influence of abbot 'Dhammajayo' and the followership he got in his temple 'Wat Phra Dhammakaya' in the Pathum Thani province of Thailand over the years, the criminal charges against the abbot and the widely publicized standoff with police units in 2017 since when he 'disappeared'.The documentary gives a voice to both followers and critics, and does a quite good and balanced job in that, although the producers hardly hide having mixed feelings about the temple and their monk's practices of fundraising, which were given as the reason behind the standoff.Personally, I felt that much of the things the documentary showed, like the way some of the depicted followers behaved and talked, how the ceremonies are organized and orchestrated, and how the events are filmed by temple staff was going somewhat beyond religious belief, but struck me as set up to induce collectivist states of trance and 'blind' followership just as we see it in sects.In any way, very worthwhile watching, particularly for those interested in topics like 'politics vs religion' and the various flavors of Buddhism.",

In fact, often it's the opposite, it creates worry, angst and generates less retirement income than other strategies. This movie exposes what those strategies are, and then more interestingly, actually interviews people across the country who are retired successfully, and how they are doing it.It's fun to see people just enjoying their lives in retirement doing what they love to do. You see them describe what life is like when you don't have to worry about money for the rest of your life.",

The work is done with care and clarity not only talking about the case but also generating a debate that is still very alive, like the fight against machismo in society. On a technical and artistic level it follows a standard, although the use of some nice music is a good choice.I really liked the way it transports you to the 'San Fermines' in Pamplona and shortly after the big party has started it becomes a real and big brutal crime.'No estás sola' is important to see and emotion and information will not leave anyone indifferent. This was a horrific gang rape in Spain! And they meticulously put together the events of that horror night.It is about the fight for justice, raising crucial questions about consent, victim blaming, and societal responsibility. There is no doubt that this documentary provokes high emotions of injustice, frustration and at the same time empathy.Don't miss this one.",

I've seen it twice now and believe this should be a requirement in high school. Yes, to graduate and move forward.

Because I learned nothing from the documentary, I looked at wiki, and it is at the very least heavily plagiarized, or just read straight off. Since the visuals add nothing to the topic, just read the Wiki entry at your leisure, especially since the German names are mangled/mispronounced.",

The movie starts at 8 am (12 hours before kickoff), and people from all over England are descending upon London, already heavily drinking, and many without tickets for the game. What could go wrong? At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this movie brings a chilling account of the events on July 11, 2021, leading up to the game. A number of factors were heavily at play: first, this was England's fist chance since 1966 to win a major trophy; second, as in 1966, they would also be hosting the event; third, due to COVID delaying the tournament by a year, this was the first time people would be out and celebrating en masse; and last but not least: the English authorities vastly underestimated what was about to transpire. In short: all elements were in place for a massive for a colossal breakdown of security. The footage makes for absolute compelling if revolting viewing. I cannot readily recall having seen anything like this. The movie makers keep a tight pace throughout, and this documentary just flew by in no time.\"The Final\" Attack On Wembley\" started streaming on Netflix this weekend. Whether or not you are a soccer fan is frankly irrelevant. This is a documentary that shows what happens when an entire country is frenzied, with thousands of people determined to get into Wembley stadium, ticker or no ticket. SHOCKINGLY (not), pure mayhem and chaos ensues... Highly recommended.",

            "storyline": "Lakota Nation vs. United States educates and entertains with hard-hitting interviews and lyrical narration. It's an incredible watch for history buffs, especially those looking to learn more about a significant moment in US history.A chronicle of the Lakota people and their homeland of the Black Hills, Lakota Nation vs. United States traces the journey of a marginalized people. It starts with the Indian Wars of the 1800s, describes how sacred land was stolen in violation of treaty agreements. It progresses through the centuries all the way to today, as people protest a most ironic shrine to white supremacy, Mount Rushmore, and continue to call for the recognition of their tribal rights.The film is unique for a variety of reasons. First, it's co-directed by Jesse Short Bull - an Oglala Lakota man - and Laura Tomaselli, one of the few times in mass media we see Native Americans telling their stories. It is a wonderful touch that provides the whole film with a spirit of warmth and respect. The film is written and narrated by acclaimed Oglala poet Layli Long Soldier, and its narration will be the first thing to strike you in Lakota Nation vs. United States. The rhythmic refrain of \"X marks the spot,\" the soft, dignified, yet strong voice of Long Soldier, and the emotional roller-coaster of the story are truly mesmerizing. Tomaselli also serves as the editor of the film, and she, along with cinematographer Kevin Phillips use a wealth of archival and modern footage and rousing interviews with activists and leaders to tell this beautiful story of a land and a people who have survived exploitation, forced migration, and genocide, and who still wait for justice to come.Lakota Nation vs. United States promotes resilience, valuing culture, standing up to oppression, and honoring history. The Lakota provide us with so many lessons from which to learn and grow into better versions of ourselves.I give Lakota Nation vs. United States 5 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults. It releases July 21, 2023 in select markets and will roll out later to other locations. By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",

Here I'm thinking what Bait n switch? It was exactly as it was said to be.. Police recieve a report of a sexual assault and make an arrest on the victim. That sounds about right if u had even watched the documentary yep.Another commenter probably on crack starts talkin trash about these women as if they really were making false reports which means they didnt even watch the documentary, all they did was probs watch 10 mins in lol.This documentary points to a persistent problem in America & some ppl can't understand why victims would be pressured into admitting something? Like really ?These girls just suffered trauma that cause most to get into a life long drug addiction or suicide n now their being treated as suspects & not even in their right mind probably when in there & their being coerced through ruses that they are the suspect n lying. Have you people really not seen the many many cases out their of adult suspects who were coerced into a confession of committing a serious crime and then found to be innocent?All you people bashing these victims for how they acted, well I also thought as you did when I was younger, that how can girls suddenly change their story & not be more adamant on their version of events. I was ignorant as you ppl are now, but through time I \"learned\" alot and now I see things differently. Who are we to say a person must behave a certain way when scared? Suffering PTSD? Experiencing trauma thats so fresh just few days old & then treated like a suspect? Also the interrogation videos in this documentary were incomplete, you think all it took was 1 minute of coercing to change their stories?Maybe some of you have no idea how police interrogation works but they wear u down over time with repeated questions asked in different ways and when your a victim u cant imagine how scary it is for these underage girls to feel with a grown male cop berating them as lying and a suspect.I hope you sick people don't ever have it happen to your own family members cause when you go reporting it, the cops just may treat ur wife or daughter or family exactly how they treated these victims and exactly thats how u think of them.",

When they came for my neighbours I said nothing. Then they came for me and there was no one left to say anything.\" will play out for real. How can the danger be so clear to someone looking at this from afar, and be so disguised to someone in its midst?",

Lenin founder of Soviet Union said \"Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted.\" John Dewey, atheist - idolized in public education went to Russia 1928 to study Marxism, did everything in his power to dumb down children believing education should socialize the child to become willing tool of STATE, brought German intellectuals in 1933 dropped at Princeton, Brandeis, Berkley to go after education and media – promote homosexuality to children, excessive drinking, and destruction of religion (THAT WAS A BIG ONE) Groups of intellectuals plotting and planning to make America so corrupt it stinks.Today Hard LEFT has control of teachers unions and teachers colleges and dictates ALL educational policy. The bomb throwing, cop killing America hating, God-hating radicals of the 60's are now tenured professors – writing text books – teaching teachers. Self-perpetuating. Discovered they could remake America by going into the schools then throwing bombs!Those that take exception to this are the very ones who as Bertrand Russell bragged could be made to believe that snow is black. There is nothing that is happening in America that can not be understood by examining the 100 year effort to destroy us from within detaching us from any moral anchors whatsoever! Agenda: Grinding America Down is an epic presentation of the facts that make this case.Its not for nothing that Karl Marx tied destroying capitalism to removing God. And that butcher Stalin knew \"America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.\" Agenda: Grinding America Down needs to be seen by every decent, moral and ethical person in this country. Especially parents and grandparents. I would urge them to watch it along with their children and/or school-age grandchildren and discuss afterward. This movie is an excellent teaching tool. Eyeopener. I urge \"home-schoolers\" also to watch and share this movie with everyone in your sphere of influence.Unlike so many productions there is no foul language, there is no sex, no nudity and the violence is historical images of the aftermath of Communism which is identified as the greatest killing machine of all time given more people died under Communist regimes in the 20th century then all the wars combined!I am passionate about this movie because I was one of the \"useful idiots\" Lenin spoke of in the 60's and 70's. I had no idea till I saw this movie how I had been cynically manipulated along with my whole generation by a bunch of intellectuals whose goal was not \"peace and love\" but destruction of America. Specifically \"Make love not war\" came from Herbert Marcussa of the Frankfurt School. Changing the entire world view of Americans by what they call \"Political Correctness\" is actually Cultural Marxism first step toward Traditional Marxism. Willi Munzenberg Founder of Frankfurt School (outpost of European socialism) bragged of plan to stand American educational system on its head: make America so corrupt it stinks: started social rot. I also learned that the darling of the left Saul Alinksy dedicated his book \"Rules for Radicals\" to Lucifer - Satan. Very powerful movie and it backs up everything it presents. It will no doubt challenge the world view of those who have never been exposed to these facts. It did me at first. Then I got angry at those who have benefited from this country's freedoms and use our tolerance of the intolerant to try to destroy us from within!",

Without their success without him, I don't know how much he would've stood out to me. I just remember telling a friend in high school (mid 80's) how much I loved their music. He asked if I'd heard Piper, and I said \" Yes, but it's really strange\". After that, I gave it another listen.

No longer you will have women who literally sleep their way to the top.There was nothing much new in this documentary. It had several informative talking heads and clips from movies.The Hays Code was a straitjacket put on writers and directors but they found a way to work around the restrictions. They could be more creative or think laterally. The Hollywood film studios found out that they were making more money. Before the Hays Code, some religious groups boycotted going to the cinema.With the popularity of television in the 1950s. Cracks began to appear in the code, it was no longer fit for purpose. Independent studios were more daring in their subject matter. In the 1960s, the Hays Code started to be ignored. Even major studios were bypassing it as violence in American movies certainly increased.An informative documentary but nothing too revealing here for me.",

Spencer Matthew's seems to lack authenticity and awareness throughout as he tried to convince people of a deeper meaning that he doesn't convey.Between bear Grylls, Nims and a made in chelsea star being the directors and stars it seems there might have been more ego and self-promotion here than anything. It seemed disrespectful to rescue team to not actually include much footage of how challenging it is to do that work but also disrespectful to the families and bodies of those left on the mountain, and to the family of the Sherpa 'Wang Dorchi' that they brought back down and filmed in complete tastelessness in their worst moments.I think alot of people who are interested in mountaineering and the outdoors will be very disappointed by this film. It felt like they were trying to create the story instead of just respecting the final resting place of many people who were lost tragically.Really poor taste. Uncomfortable watching. For a documentary with so much potential it was completely misguided and staged. Beautiful footage, and maybe a good intention but post production should have stepped in to do something about this offensive train wreck before it hit the big screen.",

Junk Films is one of his three non-fiction works (3 documentaries).Junk Films is a unique assortment of very heterogeneous short films with the common theme of death, and the cultural relationship between humans and it. The short films were filmed in different locations around the world. We see in particular scenes of intervention with people who died following road accidents (the shocking side of the photo/video of death which \"leaves no room for the imagination\"), images of suicide, funeral and local/traditional celebration... It is a journey with death, with it. There is nothing sensationalist, everything is as is, without artifice. We can almost touch death with these films, it is closer to us than ever, in our daily lives. In this sense, Junk Films follows the idea of putting the viewer face to face with their fears, facing the unknown, but also - and this is essential - to enrich themselves through other cultures.It's graphic, almost surreal, and yet it's real. I think it's an artistic work too, through the editing, the choice of images. There are almost dreamlike passages (I think of the almost mummified room, covered in dust). The climax is the traditional Japanese funeral ceremony, very cold according to some, I tend to agree (I don't judge people, just what I see, and the way I see it). A Japanese spectator mentioned the death of \"David\", mentioned elsewhere by IMDB. I don't remember if his name is in the film (I wonder if it's the man hanged in his home, or the deceased from the Japanese funeral ceremony). It seems that he was a friend of the director, I'm not sure, but it remains interesting information to consider the work.Difficult to give my feelings, it is a complex work which will resonate in varied ways with each spectator. I can't say that I liked it, that would be simplistic and ridiculous. I will say that it interested me, that I was touched and that Tsurisaki Kiyotaka did remarkable work, never seen before. I still remember well the injuries/wounds on the bodies. The sadness that violence causes.I wanted to offer a brief opinion, but I think some people will be happy to have a little contextualization. And then, it's a film that doesn't leave you indifferent, there's a lot to say. The absence of commentary has a lot to do with it, the images speak and the dead are silent. It may be a celebration of life (thanks to death, to our deaths), I don't konw.One thing is certain, with Junk Films I was able to approach death, watch it, respect it, respect the victims, and that's already a lot.",

The film captures Dr. Demartini's remarkable ability to inspire personal transformation through his Breakthrough Experience workshops and individual sessions.As one of Dr. Demartini's clients featured in the documentary, I experienced a profound breakthrough in my relationship with my son. Before meeting Dr. Demartini, our relationship was strained, filled with misunderstandings and frustration. However, his powerful coaching helped me realize that accepting and loving my son as he is-and allowing him to be himself-was key.Dr. Demartini guided me to understand that I did the best I could at the time, and by accepting and loving my son, I was also accepting and loving myself. The breakthrough came with the realization that if my family changed to fit my expectations, they wouldn't be themselves.To ensure my son was comfortable with what I shared, we reviewed the rough cut of the documentary together. Dr. Demartini assured me they would cut out anything I wasn't comfortable with. My son was deeply moved by the film and was glad I spoke about our shared experience during a difficult time in our lives. He felt it would help others, and the conversation we had after viewing it together was another breakthrough for us.This transformation not only improved my relationship with my son but also enriched other aspects of my life. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to work with Dr. Demartini and to share my journey in this inspiring documentary.",

In the hands of someone other than Academy Award nominated documentary filmmaker Scott Hamilton Kennedy, I doubt it would have survived.

It could have gone back to Hildegard von Bingen and Clara Schumann where just being a female music composer was something of a revolutionary act.

Nonetheless it's very interesting, certainly if you're interested in this subject. The narrator is Matthew McConaughey, lead actor from the movie Interstellar.

Theres like a 5-10 minute blip about the creation of the game, but after that it just ends up talking about the esports/community aspects. Which, I still find interesting, but I would have much preferred a more in-depth look into how league was made. They never really talked about balancing, or the challenges of making certain champions or even the gameplay itself. Instead they focus on the rise of the league esport, the celebration of its fans, and how it can bring people together. Much more time on how the game actually was made and challenges of the game itself would make this documentary way better. Great credits music though.",

It brought up points and information that (at least to me) made me want to look into the topic even further.However, the editing was a bit cluttered but the mix of animation, video and hard-hitting narration and photos of objects/pictures/cartoons of the time. Also the music was a nice mix of hip-hop, dramatic classical, etc....In conclusion (yes I know I'm writing this like a high school essay, let me be), the movie is pretty amazing and you should at least give it a chance.",

He is notorious, however, for being very protective of licensing his music for other venues or projects, having declined many other scoring offers in the past. When a friend of Singer's saw the footage assembled to a rough cut, he suggested Shadow for the soundtrack. Singer got hold of a couple of Shadow's albums, and loved the music so much, he began to cut the music into his film without any contact with the DJ. When fellow producer Ben Freedman told him he would need the rights to the music, the duo concocted a scheme whereby they would write a note to him and give it to an attractive female friend who would go backstage after a show and personally hand-deliver it. It worked. Weeks later, the two scheduled a flight to LA to coincide with a last-minute meeting with Shadow and his agent. According to Shadow, he was prepared to turn down the men's offer to use his music. But when they showed him a rough edit of the film with his music that Singer had already cut-in, Shadow was taken aback and completely impressed. He not only let them use existing titles, but even remixed some older tracks intercut with new audio samples recorded by Singer in the tunnels as a special score done for the film.",

Then a club owner talks about how patrons collapse into a coma in his establishment because of drugs. The hedonism and subsequent self destruction that results from drug use is painful and saddening to me. This film is an eye opener for alternative lifestyles, and is definitely not for the lighthearted.",

            "storyline": "In 2020, a rag tag group of Venezuelan dissidents and American private military contractors landed at Macuto Bay, Venezuela, with the intention of overthrowing the authoritarian government of (legally designated U. S. foreign adversary) Nicholas Maduro. Days before the landing, the plot was revealed on Venezuelan television and supposedly paid for by the leader of the Venezuelan government-in-exile, Juan Guaido. The shoddy plan and audacity of it all made it one of 2020's most interesting news stories, in a year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic.From this story comes Men of War, a documentary following the events leading up to \"Operation Gideon\" and its aftermath, primarily through the lens of the Canadian born, American special ops dude-turned-mercenary, Jordan Goudreau. To say Goudreau is a character ripped straight out of Hollywood would be an understatement. He's such an incredibly fascinating person that I sort of wish the directors followed him more.Men of War follows an inherently interesting and wild story that DEFINITELY deserves the full documentary treatment. There are so many great twists and turns, interesting characters, geopolitical intrigue, and conspiracy, it honestly writes itself. That being said, I think this movie is a testament to the reality that execution matters. You can have compelling people or events, but if a documentary doesn't share the information in a compelling and efficient way, it suffers.To that end, I am sorry to say that Men of War is lacking in the presentation front. The directors definitely had intention in the way the film was cut and put together; a fast paced, spy thriller style intended to convey how Jordan sees the world (a \"post-modern soldier,\" as director Billy Corben put it). However, I couldn't help but feel the doc needed to slow down a bit, let us get our bearing before info dumping on us for a good 45 minutes or so.Eventually, as the pieces are set and we settle into more interviews, the movie slows down, but I can't help but feel there was a bit of artistry lacking here at times. Sometimes we'd cut to images or clips that almost felt as if they were \"over explaining\" things. I'd be genuinely curious to see how many distinct clips were used in it, because at a certain point, the film's pacing was just exhausting to be honest.I also felt like key details that SHOULD'VE been focused on were not. Like, for example, the actual nuts and bolts of the plan these men were attempting to execute. It'd be nice to get a sense of what they were trying to do. I think it'd also be nice to understand the political context a bit more; why Venezuela was in the state it was and why the United States would have an interest in overthrowing Maduro. I follow geopolitics pretty closely, but I can imagine for the uninitiated, it would be hard to understand.Overall, I enjoyed Men of War but I do hope there's a slightly more restrained and focused version of this movie out there. This story deserves to be told and I think with some tweaks, this thing could be really special.",

At times, they are honest and say they don't know if they want to continue with the treatments. But what it says to me is- you just take one day at a time. The will to live is strong in these ladies. They continue on with their lives between Chemo and surgeries. One lady rides horses, even though some days she feels awful she still feels good on the horses. That is what they seem to do is to keep busy and finding things to take their mind off of the negative and put their energy into something else. Also, surround yourself with people, with friends, even if you are not in a current relationship. This helps keep your spirits up.",

The film itself has re-enactments as the great Powers Boothe narrates the story of early settlers who ended up in a fight for life and would eventually have to go to cannibalism in order to survive.DEAD OF WINTER: THE DONNER PARTY isn't the greatest documentary out there but it certainly gets the job done in regards to giving people an education on every aspect of the Donner Party and not just the fact that they had to eat human flesh. The documentary covers earlier parts of their journey including all the things that had to go wrong in order for the group to end up where they did. We learn about various decision they made that would come back to haunt them but of course the main focus comes towards the end when they were left dying and without food.If you're familiar with the story then it's doubtful you're going to learn anything new here. The re-enactments certainly aren't the greatest but they're at least entertaining and look authentic.",

It's very stylised in places, beautifully shot sequences flexing the £4.5 mil budget. Maybe not a huge surprise with Ridley Scott's son Jake at the helm. It doesn't lose its focus though. This is Eliud Kipchoge's attempt to be the first human to run a marathon in under 2 hours. There was a lot of hype around this when it took place in Vienna in October 2019, so there's no real surprises. How many people know that much about Kipchoge though, aside the world records and that he makes distance running look ridiculously easy. Here we get stories from trainers, coaches, pacemakers, physios, Eliud himself. Not just about the attempt, that's just the current goal, but the bedrock of running and being a runner. He's clearly gifted, built to run fast, trains hard, but there's lots of athletes like that. It's the mental strength that's the focus. That's the engine. That's not unique either, but Kipchoge seems to have everything in perfect balance. We know he's the best. The greatest marathon runner of all time, he must know it too, but it doesn't seem to effect him, he's the definition of humble. A genuinely nice person. Just seeing himself as part of the machine striving for something historical. There's lots of detail. How high altitude training works. Genetics. Culture. Colonial politics. Pain threshold. Failed attempts and BELIEF. I've heard a lot about the use of pacemakers, lights measuring the perfect line and of course shoes. How all this stuff delegitimises this record. Utter bollocks. It might help focus the mind, but it would probably implode a few too. The fact is, running at that pace for 2 hours would destroy 99.99% humans on the planet. The fact that Kipchoge embraces it is what makes him special. Dave Beresford features quite a lot as the logistics man around the attempt in Vienna with his \"marginal gains\". The course choice, fuelling, formation, the tech, the team. This is where the science comes in... and the machine of a branding exercise. Visually for a period it becomes the INEOS challenge rather than Kipchoge. He's merely a vessel. I suspect though that he doesn't mind that, it takes the pressure off... if indeed he ever feels any. What I love about running is the simplicity of it. Grab shoes. Go (probably shorts too). It seems a bit ludicrous the amount of fuss and staging for this, but then the challenge is ludicrous. 26.1 miles in under 2 hours, how is that possible? Driving music, slomo shots, Kipchoge in white on his own surrounded by the pacemakers in black, it's built for drama. The target is an average of 13mph, the numbers are staggering. The teamwork though is absolutely beautiful. The entire goal, to make it as easy for Kipchoge as possible. A remarkable sacrifice from everyone that ran that day, but also the opportunity to be part of something truly unique, truly inspiring. It's not easy, it's fraught with things that can go wrong, but at the core Kipchoge is calm, focussed, fast. That's the takeaway. This attempt is not about headlines, technology, controversy. It's one bloke. Running. Like no one has ever done before. \"No human is limited\".",

The cinematography is beautiful, with artistic shots and soft colors that create a calming atmosphere, perfectly balancing Nathan Hilu's chaotic and intricate drawings. This visual contrast really drew me into his world.Even though it deals with heavy topics like the Nuremberg trials, it explores themes of memory and understanding one's past, which feel universal and relatable. The film builds suspense masterfully, and the ending not only provides closure but also prompts deep reflection on the nature of truth and the human psyche.I believe it's a film that resonates on many levels, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deeply moving, emotional documentary.",

            "storyline": "Whole movie revolves around gender. It tells stories about transgender people, their relationship with their gender, their identities and sometimes parts of their transition stories. It shows various people - younger and older, white and BIPOC, fat and thin, with different level of passing. You can really feel inclusivity and diversity of trans and non-binary community.These different portrayals combined tell a longer story of Virginia Woolf's Orlando and sometimes they are even creating monologue (or letter) addressed to the writer herself.Whole movie is a meaningful voice in a discussion about gender. It critiques gender binary as a patriarchal concept. It shows different perspectives, experiences, transgressions.The movie is not so much about sexual orientation though (which was written in a movie's summary on a cinema's webpage) if you're more interested in that topic. Although these two are deeply intertwined.Also, I think you should have at least basic understanding of concepts like gender, gender binary, transition etc. To enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend it as a first movie for cis straight people who are far from queer culture and community.I hope this movie will be available on streaming services so a broader audience could access it.",

However, even non-fans of felines are likely to be enchanted by the cats inhabiting the Shinto shrine in a small Japanese coastal town. We see them being fed by well-wishers, being caught to be 'fixed', sharing food with their kittens, etc. But it is not all cats: humans feature as well, in sequences such as an interminable committee meeting and clearing up after a typhoon.The problem with making an 'observational film' of this sort is the small likelihood that people with a camera pointed at them actually behave as they normally do - so how much does the documentary-maker change by the mere fact of their presence? As a result, can we really say what we are seeing is accurate? But in its presentation of a slice of Japanese life, the film is at least worth watching once.",

Centering on the Vardanyan family's relentless search for their son and brother, Soghomon, it is a visceral portrayal of the human cost of conflict.The film's strength lies in its intimacy. Filmed by Soghomon's sister, Shoghakat, it offers an unfiltered view into the family's heartbreak and resilience. Her decision to document such vulnerable moments - from anguished searches to the excruciating wait for DNA confirmation - draws viewers into the unbearable weight of uncertainty and grief. At times, the rawness of the footage is almost too much to bear, making the film a difficult but necessary watch.What makes 1489 so poignant is how it bridges the gap between the personal and the political. By focusing on one family's ordeal, it illuminates the profound impact of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in a way that no news report or statistic ever could. Soghomon, a talented young musician with dreams, is not just \"missing in action\" - he is a son, a brother, and a symbol of the countless lives disrupted by war.The film's unflinching honesty may challenge viewers, but it is also its most powerful aspect. 1489 serves as a testament to the enduring pain of those left behind and a stark reminder of the humanity behind every number. It is a deeply moving and unforgettable exploration of love, loss, and the unyielding search for answers.",

I love God (Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, too). I'm a strong Christian, believe in God's Word, and am a practicing Apologist learning from the likes of Cliff Knecktle, Lee Strobel, J. Warmer Wallace, Justin Peters, David & Mike McDonald, Institute for Creation Research, Answers In Genesis, and several others. I LOVE this subject, and am also a strong proponent for freedom.However, I felt the history of the horrors of Socialism/Communism is important. It's OK to tell people about your opinions - no issue w/ that - but the focus should be on the history and horrors, not on opinions.Unlike another reviewer, I love that they told people about Jesus...that's the MOST vital thing. Beyond my minor complaint, I still really like this film and think everyone should watch it.",

Follow the protagonists from idealistic college students to founders of the medical group Partners in Health, delivering state-of-the-art treatment to the poorest in rural Haiti, to advocates for top-line healthcare delivery to the poor around the world. They showed it could be done and then demanded that the medical establishment revise its views about what is possible on a global scale.

If you've ever worked with Mexicans you know that we banter and play constantly even in tough jobs.I wish i could recommend this but it actually upset me how lifeless it all feels.

I never thought a single movie could bring together so much information in such a powerful, thought-provoking way. It forces you to re-examine the world around you and wonder: how much of what we believe is actually true? This film doesn't just entertain; it opens your eyes to the subtle yet pervasive ways we are influenced. A truly remarkable piece of cinema that leaves you reflecting long after the credits roll.",

I've enjoyed a large percentage of his works and hold him in high regard within the industry.A documentary about him I saw great potential in, sadly the execution is very sterile. It's not exactly an expose or even a biopic, it's a very bland by the book look at his life and his works with contributions from his peers.This to me is a passable and eye opening watch for mega-fans, but for anyone else it's an unforgivable bore.RantsSomething has always bothered me about Argento, and that's his use of his daughter Asia. He cast her frequently through his works even from a young age, yet the consistency is nudity and sex involving her and that just never sat right with me and raised questions I'm entirely certain I don't want the answers to. To him it's likely harmless, to her it's likely harmless, to me it has made my skin crawl since the first time I saw it.BreakdownInformative\nSome decent contributors\nRather boring\nNo surprises, no frills, just the facts.",

This film is artistic, spectacular and profound - a rare feat in documentary. The film transports you to the big protest-cities that emerged at Delhi borders when thousands of farmers gathered in 2020-21 to protest the new agricultural ordinances that posed a threat to their livelihood. The farmers remained resolute on the highways for 13 months, through chilly winters, heatwaves and monsoons. Mind you, this was the covid period when Delhi and most of India was under a lockdown. I believe the protest could have been about anything, this film is about the people - their rootedness, their resourcefulness, their organisational capabilities, their belief that truth will always be victorious. Their sun-baked faces, and hands don't need words. The old women, for me were the most inspiring thing about this film.

It is a poetic, sensual, political and nuanced exploration of a unique place on earth, the only truly international lesbian village in the world, Skala Eressos. As a \"double lesbian,\" filmmaker Tzeli captures the needs, longings, missteps, incredible courage and creativity of the women-loving-women who traveled to Eressos from all over the world in search of freedom and a homeland, and also documents the evolving tensions and growing reconciliation with the conservative Greek locals who at first didn't understand what a lesbian was, then thought only foreigners and not locals could be lesbians, and ultimately came to proclaim, \"To see two girls in love -- it's their right!\" Tzeli also shares bits of her own journey. I've seen the movie four times and will watch it again - each time it moves me in a different way. In addition to the story, the cinematography is just gorgeous, including sensuous underwater and landscape shots that will make you feel as if you're right there. Essential viewing for lesbians and anyone who loves us, as well as anyone fascinated by the sociology or cultural anthropology.",

They film them engaging with each other, then completely lose them when they fight and cut to them just being wounded afterwards. They also miss the cheetah chasing the young male. 2 major points of the narrative completely missed by the cameramen. This shows how unprepared the film crew are. Shame, because it's generally filmed well when slow moments are occurring. The main issue for me, however, is the shocking choice of music which distracts you from the narrative and beauty. Whoever signed off on the funky pop music should be embarrassed. It would have been so much better if the music was more ethereal and intense. I just found myself getting frustrated by it.",

Hell, it'd make a great spark of classroom discussion and debate even.One of the best things The Accountant of Auschwitz does is provide different sides of the argument. Who should be prosecuted (accountants, guards, executioners) and to what degree? Should anyone be forgiven? It doesn't really tell the audience how to feel. It just thoroughly informs and leaves the conversation entirely up to them.There's an event that really caught me by surprise (the lady). I wasn't sure how to feel about it at first. While the act was understandable-ish, the prosecution should definitely continue. Now that I think about it, it reminds me of a documentary called Long Night's Journey Into Day (2000), which examines 4 out of 7000 cases that were brought before South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) since 1994 \"to mediate between those seeking amnesty from apartheid-related crimes and the families of their victims.\" The TRC's restorative justice method is a stark contrast to the Nuremberg's Trials' retributive justice. I highly recommend watching both within the same week and asking yourself which is most appropriate for South Africa's apartheid and Germany's antisemitism.",

He was my introduction into adult horror literature. I own all his older works and am someone that eventually picks up his newer titles as well. Seeking out the adaptations of his works was something else I did when expanding my horror knowledge from what we already owned. This was a documentary that I watched at work, treating it like a podcast, watching when something truly caught my attention and listened to the rest.What is a shame here is that they couldn't get King himself to be a part of it. What I do like though is that the people who are interviewed are filmmakers who have adapted his works. There is charm there, because as a fan of King, it is fun to see that the likes of Frank Darabont, Tom Holland, Mike Flanagan, Mick Garris and Greg Nicotero are the same. It makes me feel like I'm part of a club. It is truly amazing to hear how many books/short stories/screenplays that King has and then even crazier the number that have also been adapted.I do have issues here and it falls in line with others that I saw review this on Letterboxd. It focuses quite a bit on the fact that King hates Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining. We also have all these people who are interviewed here who are on the side of King. This is an argument and a stance that has grown tiresome. I did find it more interesting hearing Flanagan say how he swayed King to his vision for Doctor Sleep, blending Kubrick with the source for both books.Another issue I have is that this focuses on work more than others. Keeping it more balanced would be preferred. I get that not every production would be as interesting. Hearing Darabont talk about The Shawshank Redemption is something that I enjoyed, but that seems more for a special feature for that film. Including stories or more information for other adaptations would be something I'm more intrigued by.This is still impressive to see all the people that were involved. I thought this was well-made, including the editing of footage to help visually show what people were talking about. What they did here was fine, but I do think that a bit different approach would make this work better personally. Still worth a watch for King fans, whether it is his writing or his films.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",

The filmmakers created a sensitive and complex picture of how high control groups like this develop and protect the leaders. I hope they are helped and this cult is broken up. Any negative reviews here are obviously from people trying to protect the leaders who are violating the basic human rights of hundreds of people. Just tragic.",

She worked with Daava and Zaya on their own terms to create something authentic and true to their character.In the film Daava tells a Mongolian legend where lost travelers stumble upon a mirage. A woman serves them tea. Later everyone dies except the one who didn't drink the tea. This is the one who never gave up on their dream and refused to drink what was false.",

For those of us who collect BB there is very little media attention given to the historical significance of BB. I thought the doc was well done, the narrator seemingly not liking dolls at the beginning and then saying she liked them at the end I found to be fake for the sake of the documentary and unnecessary. At least that is how it came across. The inclusion of certain commentators was also puzzling. Why was Gabourey Sidibe, who had no experience with BB or anything of value to add to the documentary included? Was she there for window dressing or did the producers want to make a point? I still don't get it. At least other contributors could relay their direct experience either owning or playing with the dolls. The social experiment with the children and the dolls was interesting but was too long and should have been edited. Although the scene of the black boy grabbing up the white barbie claiming she is the nicest, prettiest etc..is a scene that will never leave me. My goodness I hope his parents are able to help him overcome his lack of self awareness. It also would have been interesting to see actual BB collections of people, like myself who have spent decades cultivating their collection. Maybe expand the documentary outside of the scope of a few people. The discussions with Kitty Black Perkins and the Mattel employees was fascinating and I would of liked to hear more details about specific dolls, especially the vintage ones including the black males. Christie/Brad /Francie/Cara/Curtis. This documentary was a decent effort but I found it lacking in many areas.",

The one thing I'm grateful for is the very minimal amount of bad reenactment acting- t although its limited presence is, indeed, terrible. The only reason I suffered through this is because I'm interested in serial killers and I have never heard of this particular one- it was seriously a chore to watch this whole thing. Additionally I think it should be noted that in my 48 years of movie watching I've never been compelled to write a bad review about anything before today.

Today, he states, religion and spirituality needs to be inclusive not exclusive, and that so much of what goes on in Jesus' name is actually anti-Christ in its energy and direction.In his New York Times bestselling book \"Love Wins\" Bell challenged the belief that sinners would burn in Hell for eternity and felt this concept enabled the established Churches to control their congregants with fear. In his 2017 book \"What is the Bible\" he again challenges many long held tenets of the Church. A good portion of the film shows Bell speaking to large and enthusiastic crowds at his book signings or other venues, often inserting well placed and effective humor.Naturally, his popularity and platforms have made the religious conservatives and evangelicals quite upset and they have denounced his writings and words, labeling him a heretic of the Christian ChurchThe doc is quite brief running only about 1 hr. and 12 mins. in length, and I would say it you want to get the old brain cells cranked up this film can offer some very interesting concepts and at the very least things to \"chew on\".",

Moreover, Americans in general tend to treat their Presidents with a respect that is wholly absent from British politics; although Eugene Jarecki's documentary is actually not bad in challenging the myths (both that everything Reagan did was good, and also that he did everything that has been attributed to him), in it's tone, it can't help but add to them. In fact, it's pretty soft on his early years, and fails to mention that as Governor of California, his trick was really to talk like a conservative but to spend like only liberals were supposed to (although it concedes the same point with regard to his subsequent presidency). On the presidency itself, Jarecki's film delivers a harder verdict, as the critics are far more precise than the admirers, who can only defend Reagan through vague eulogy. It's a bit odd, however, that the final verdict on Reagan's years, and American society, is given by a former military officer who seems no more entitled to pass the definitive opinion than any of the rest of us. One interesting thing for me was to see that Reagan was, at his peak, a genuinely accomplished performer - dismissed as senile by his enemies perhaps before he truly was, he comes across as shrewder than popular perception allows, even if one can dispute the value of his legacy.",

Alas, it does not attempt to find a balance with the democratic goodies that everyone is able to create new content and distribute it, independent of official journals and studios.All in all, the parts about the history of photographing and filming are much better and more informative than the parts about the present and the future.

Unless it's documenting two of the most obnoxious and insufferable women and how they both manage their narcissistic personality disorder.The two 'stars' attempt to point out the unfairness of the household division of labor. Which is a topic more suited for a conversation with those in the household. As a feature film, it's an almost laughable issue. And wouldn't you know it- according to both of the women it's all men's fault. In one case- Eve Rodsky, it's all one man's fault; her husband. As she earnestly recounts the time she had a nervous breakdown while driving because her husband sent her a text message asking if she remembered to pick up blueberries (she did not). But not to worry- she then goes on to explain her revolutionary idea: to add up every bit of micro activity she does in a day. This includes non-action things like; \"chase kids around.\" Riveting. The other- Katie Porter, is a portly single mom and politician. After a lengthy, hyperbolic and grating account of her plight regarding childcare it's not entirely difficult to see why she's single.There's also a comical attempt to blame Covid for sexism and the perceived set backs in women's rights in the U. S. By the end I was left assuming this was intended to have the same sort of impact as those posters with cats and motivational quotes on them. Otherwise, it was a failure.Also, the one and only other review here rating this a 10/10 reads like someone who is clearly connected with the film.",

It is pointless and fairly understandable why this is a IMAX labeled movie.

By demonstrating to the audience how a country's currency is simply a public tool that we have collective say in how to use, the film opens up new areas of debate in how public spending can and should be conducted.Regardless of your political views, this film has something for you. Whether you hate the idea of taxes and inflation, or love the idea of ending climate change and inequality, you are doing yourself a favor by hearing the arguments laid out in this film.

These are people whose physical genitalia doesn't match the normal presentation for their chromosomal sex. For this reason, these are people for whom gender at birth is ambiguous, since they have biological traits of both genders.This first great thing about this movie is that it presents cases where the phrase \"gender assigned at birth\" makes sense and is explained! I'm a liberal voter, but have bristled at how trans vocabulary uses \"gender assigned at birth\". I never got it- how could gender be \"assigned\"? By profiling intersex people, this movie explains cases where in fact gender is very deliberately chosen.The second great thing about this movie is that it presents intersex conditions simply as \"different bodies\", people for whom a typical combination of chromosomes and genital anatomy didn't happen. I think most people can point to something that makes their body different from \"normal\"- intersex people just had this happen when it came to their sexual anatomy. The concept of \"different bodies\" really humanized intersex, and by extension, trans, people for me. You can physically see on an intersex body why gender is ambiguous. What's not to say that trans people had different sex hormones in utero, and their brains are different? In order words- trans bodies are different too- we just can't see the differences?Finally, the third and last great thing about this movie is the story told by Alicia Roth Weigel. She is a beautiful, blond-haired, dress-wearing, very feminine looking woman. If you saw her on the street, you'd think she is a typical woman, but she has XY chromosomes! She is the perfect spokesperson to show that genital anatomy and chromosomes together don't fit perfectly into two boxes. Trans stories are often told by people whose physical look is atypical for their gender. Ms Weigel tells her story as someone who identifies as a woman and also looks very feminine.",

Award winning director Anthony Wonke keeps the focus on Skoro's devoted American wife and children as he allows Skoro to tell his tale of bravery and desertion by the American government after 12 long years of exile in the Middle East.Skoro is at times calm, happy, stoic and gentle as he recollects coming to America, meeting his Albanian American wife and struggling to support his extended family back home. He is only emotional when he recounts his sorrow at making bad choices which hurt his wife and children. He is a military man who exhibits the ability to handle danger and think on his feet. The director said it best at the Q and A after the first screening. \" This is not James Bond or Jason Bourne, but a flawed man\" who had to infiltrate one of the deadliest groups and control his emotions in order to survive and achieve his main goal of coming back to America.If hanging with a terrorist group is not bad enough, Skoro is threatened with exposure and then almost killed as he walks in a parking garage to meet a contact. Skoro calls for help and instead he is unceremoniously abandoned. This is where the story goes off the rails and in true Jason Bourne fashion Skoro realizes that he must find his own way back.And if he gets there, will they jail or deport him as a terrorist?The twists and turns of this tale is worth a dramatic treatment, but in the meantime, this heartfelt saga of a man who remained devoted to his American dream is affectionately recounted by his wife, two daughters and Skoro himself, as they struggle to protect him from certain harm without the slightest tinge of resentment. It is skillfully produced by Johnny Haworth, Ivan Mactaggert, and I am sure there will be no trouble finding distribution for this team. The narrative is seamless, thanks to meticulous editing by Stephan Ellis.",

The doc purports to show at close-quarters a heroic defence by brave fighters of their homeland, but any value in their story is completely undermined by the distractingly shoddy filmmaking.The camera work is appalling - it's as if a child was asked to film the thing and given no instruction. The narrative is incoherent, you get no sense of the wider context or why we should care about these stories - it's a total mess. For what should be an intense and powerful tale, you end up yawning and thinking that if the film-makers couldn't be bothered to take this undertaking seriously, why should I?There have been already been some great long-form reports on this conflict that - Channel 4 in the UK have shown many. This is a travesty and to be avoided.",

I'm shocked that they're wearing clothes right now. I've never met two people, and this is from prior to [them] getting together, that they'll just get naked and pretty much have zero reservations about it. I think this translates into the film, within a larger sense, nudity is the least revealing thing in the film. It never gets clinical, but it's one of those things that's just like a celebration of bodies in a way, but also that's not the rawest thing of the film. Watching it, it's painful in so many other ways. The nudity feels like the least saucy part of it. I've seen you guys emotionally naked in far worse positions than you guys having pleasurable-looking sex.\"",

It is a horrible experience to all involved and of course, great losses to the victims' families and their circle of friends. But these guys, despite the odds, went about their way of honouring what it all meant for them and for that it truly is a great tribute.If you ask me, it has given me a bit of inspiration that someday I will become a technical diver and be good at it. There is this crazy in-explainable thing about it. Expedition, exploration of uncharted territory is what one will see from outside but inside the minds of these courageous professionals it's different world. Psychologically, the peace of mind, calmness and stillness achieved to be able to successfully carry out such dives and recovery operation is testament to some of the best and most valuable qualities of human being.There are no frills and no bells and whistles. Go in with open mind and keep your calm. This is probably one of the best documentaries I have watched in long time.",

            "storyline": "Saw this at IDFA 2024, the documentary film festival in Amsterdam. Fascinating extrapolation of the upheaval after giraffe Marius was put down by the Copenhagen Zoo, an action that was misunderstood by virtually everyone world-wide. Compelling existential questions are raised and put before a variety of experts, and partly answered or at least reasoned about it while we watch and learn.Particularly interesting were the multitude of reactions from the USA. One celebrity tried to buy Marius, but his 3-million-dollar offer was flatly refused by the zoo-director, the reaction of the latter being described as cold and devoid of animal care. A zoo owner in Chechnya was also shown a few times, having other arguments to take over Marius, but he was refused too. The remains of Marius were dissected in full public view, including children, the latter fact also misunderstood, as per a Fox News show where was said that the children watched it \"in horror\" (we saw nothing of the kind, merely interested looks instead of horror). And on top of all that misconduct, again as per the critics, the remains of Marius were fed to the lions, everything in public view. The zoo-director got every opportunity to explain why he did what he did, over and over telling us that all this was part of normal life and there was nothing wrong with showing it to adults and children alike.Lots of scientists were consulted about the issues above, and many other related topics. That is where the existential questions come in. Think of what \"consciousness\" is (which animals have it and which not??), and what about \"life\"?? Despite the variety of experts consulted, there were no easy answers and no easy solutions.All in all, a fascinating journey along notions of life/creation/existence and consciousness. Thought provoking, providing ample material to talk about after the screening. The horrified reactions all over the world went past me. I may be prejudiced because of being grown up on a farm where life and death are close by phenomena, contrary to people for whom it remains hidden where their food comes from.",

            "storyline": "Documentaries have changed over the years and God the Father is possibly the best examples of this changed.A discussion of the life of Michael Franzese, called by the media the Prince of Crime during his time as a mobster from 1975 to 1995, then after 20 years, he was able to walk away from the life with the help of Jesus Christ. The documentary interviews this man and we get a look at his life from his own mouth. I like this part because he preaches how Jesus changed his life referring to this man (and that's exactly what he called him too) as a the one and only real Man's Man because of the way he lived his life, I'll agree with that one. Fitting that a \"man's man\" can changed an Italian mobsters life so much that he becomes loyal to him. This was also the weakest part of the doc because outside of his immediate family and church friends, no one else was intensely interviewed, but in all fairness, anyone else who could have gave insight is either dead, doing life behind bars or would consider it snitching.The doc makes up for this with Television coverage of Franzese during his hey day, in a move that I've seen in a lot of recent documentaries. Which makes perfect sense as man cannot bite dog anymore with out it being caught on camera. Also to make up for the lack of interviews, the filmmakers did a lot of Dramatization with actors acting out the words of Franzese.As well as having animated clips that mostly gave insight on how Franzese felt in certain situations that would be milestones in his life. But the most interesting segments were these dance interpretations that told the story of the relationship between he and his wife, the woman that he thanks for giving him a reason to want to change. the funny thing about it is that his wife is interviewed in the movie as well, and it's mentioned that she's a dancer. Wink, Wink. I'm not saying that I did not like the dance numbers, watching thick legged women prance around the screen is never bad, but it is interesting that his wife is a dancer and they have these dance numbers in the movie that don't really move the story along, per say. Just saying. Once again, not the best doc but it had some unique features in it worth seeing if you are a fan of documentaries.",

The camera work, the collected footage and the interweaving of the story lines is outstanding.What I admire about this documentary is also what it does not do. It is not out for hatred against \"the enemy\". Although it definitely takes sides against the war it is not ideological and it is not educational in a superficial sense. It also does not drown you in despair and helplessness.This is a very impressive, timely, careful and well made anti-war documentary. It is a heart-wrenching and often heart-breaking love letter to the people of Ukraine whose suffering, resiliance and care is shown.I just hope that very many people will see it!",

Furthermore, it was annoying and unnecessary to use emotional music in some scenes.Can I recommend this biography? Well, yes, but as a biography only. I think it may be a little thin for people who would like to know more about his body of work (e.g. Living a free sexuality, against organized religion, iintroduction to meditation techniques and energy therapy).

A mostly charismatic and sympathetic cast of characters tells the story, and the filmmakers manage to get some of the bad guys in too. The film also surprises with a great dose of humor and levity. The Malaysian subjects particularly bring a lot of heart and warmth to the film. Creative visuals capture the flavor and rhythms of the region, and the soundtrack really shines.

It was not until she was well into production that she realized her excursion into this \"over-the-top world that Fellini couldn't have made up\" was taking a personal toll. Compiling the clips, she found herself inexplicably obsessed with and aroused by the very images she considered violent and degrading. \"First, I was irate at some of this stuff,\" she said. \"I watched these movies and I hated them. But my body was telling me something different. I didn't realize I had such a shadow side to my own sexuality. I found myself getting turned on, and it horrified me.\" The clips also awakened long-suppressed memories of being sexually molested as a child, the pleasure of being touched coupled with the fear of being controlled by adults. This connection is made clear in the movie by home movie footage of her as a young girl cavorting about naked. The irony was not lost on Springer that movies she considered damaging helped her to grow and \"become stronger.\" \"That's a very confusing thing,\" she said. \"This is the last place I would have looked for healing, believe me.\"",

            "storyline": "Stray is a brilliant film about three beautiful dogs living on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey. Director Elizabeth Lo gives a unique perspective that allows viewers to venture into dogs' lives and learn a lot about the country of Turkey and the people there, as well. Through the eyes of the dogs we learn about their lives on the streets and the lives of others they interact with. We gain a better understanding of the people as we overhear conversations the citizens are having which tell us a lot about the personal lives of the people there and the living conditions. For both the dogs and some of the people, there is danger and the struggle to survive. There are also touching moments. It is an unforgettable film that helps people understand a different part of the world, the people and animals that live there, and that they all have the same basic needs of food, shelter, and friendship.This documentary follows three dogs named Zeytin, Nazar and a puppy named Kartal. The camera follows the dogs at their level which is a very ingenious and a creative touch. As the camera rolls, we follow along and see how these dogs interact with other dogs and the humans they encounter. Not only do we get to experience a stray dog's life, but the lives of a young group of boys also living on the streets. The dogs in Istanbul are allowed to roam around the city freely since the citizens fought to save them. We're taken into these dogs' lives and live it with them, seeing all the sights and sounds they see.One of my favorite scenes in Stray is when Zeytin is in the park and notices another dog approaching. You can tell from the beginning, when we first get to know Zeytin, that she is a sweet dog. She doesn't seem to mind the other dogs she comes in contact with and is friendly towards them. Watching Zeytin and the other dogs in the park was very enjoyable. I just loved watching them run around and being very playful. It is a scene that could have been in any part of the world. I also enjoyed watching the puppy, Kartal. The puppy's expressions are very sweet and, the way people react to Kartal, it adds a nice touch to the film.The message in this film is to step up for what you believe in. The citizens of Turkey made sure their voices were heard, so that dogs can freely roam, and are not to be held captive or destroyed. Every life is worth something. The dogs provide comfort to many people there. There are some warnings. Some scenes can be graphic that go with life on the streets. Some of the topics and language spoken by some of the people is also for older viewers.I give Stray 5 out of 5 stars. I was glued to the screen and I am now a much bigger fan of documentaries after watching this film. I plan to watch more in the future. I recommend this film to ages 13 to 20.

This 3 and a half hour \"film\" could have been cut down to probably 35 minutes and you would probably understand it better, we had to watch this for school and people still walked out and let their grade get punished for it. Sure some films decide to choose sending a message over being entertaining but this film has so much unnecessary footage added to it that you forget what is even happening. I see no value in watching this movie in full, there is a shot of a lighthouse that lasted so long it felt like the projector broke and switched over to someone's screen saver. Maybe if you can fast forward all of that you could knock the film out in less then a hour and save time.",

Despite the large number of members, it was impressive how none of them felt overshadowed; each had their own moments to shine.The close bond between the group members really stands out, making it easy for fans to connect with them. Their individual voices and talents are diverse and captivating, and even though roles like \"main rapper\" or \"main dancer\" exist, each member's contribution is valued. The dancing was particularly enjoyable and showcased their skills well.Overall, the movie was a great introduction to the group and left me excited to explore more of their music.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. Is it nostalgia? Is it history? Is it activism? Is it entertainment? This documentary from Erik Nelson is all of the above and more. It's an incredible treat for viewers as well as providing a snapshot in time of a week that influenced changes in daytime television talk shows. In 1972, the host of the most popular daytime TV show invited John Lennon and Yoko Ono to co-host \"The Michael Douglas Show\". Was it a clash of cultures? Yes it was. Was it TV magic? Absolutely.Let's be real ... this was quite a risk for the time. Mike Douglas was a popular host because his daytime show was relatively benign and moderately entertaining for those watching television during the day. To invite John and Yoko, the 'radicals' accused not only of breaking up The Beatles, but also for being quite extreme in their counterculture thoughts and actions, was a courageous act and one that risked turning off a substantial portion of the audience. And this wasn't just one show on one day. Douglas went all in - John and Yoko were to co-host a full week ... five shows where they selected the guests.Director Nelson wisely divided the documentary into segments of the five shows in order so that we can follow along. Show number one aired February 14, 1972 - a fitting date since John and Yoko stated they were looking to spread love and peace with their message. The first show featured some honest admissions from Lennon, as well as an in-depth interview with Ralph Nader. Just 38 at the time, the uber-intelligent Nader was viewed as an alarmist and extremist, though much of what he preached has since come true. Ninety-year-old Nader appears in the documentary recollecting his appearance and proving that he remains engaged and sharp even today.The second show included folk singer Nobuko Miyomoto and activist and anti-war demonstrator Jerry Rubin. It's fascinating to see Mike Douglas have a discussion with Rubin, and obviously Lennon and Yoko shared many of the same beliefs as Rubin, who comes across as a passionate, level-headed spokesperson. The third show is a musical highlight as John Lennon meets (for the first time) one of the rock pioneers he idolized, Chuck Berry. The two legends shared the stage to perform \"Memphis, Tennessee\". We hear them harmonize, watch Chuck Berry do his duck walk, and are subjected to Yoko screeching into the microphone. Two other guests on the show were Macrobiotic diet chef Hilary Nedleaf and David Rosenbloom, the latter whom demonstrated his biofeedback music utilizing brainwaves. Both are also interviewed today about their appearance on the show. Singer and Broadway performer Vivian Reed performs on the fourth show while modern day Vivian Reed giddily watches the clip of herself. Black Panthers leader Bobby Seale discusses the charity programs he's involved with and still manages to get his beliefs on the record. It's on this show where John Lennon performs his classic, \"Imagine\".The fifth and final show has George Carlin as a guest, as well as a doctor lamenting the importance of reducing one's blood pressure. It's probably the most disappointing segment since we get very little of young Carlin and his quick wit. TV Producer E. V. Di Massi provides periodic commentary, and Yoko instills a bit of her performance art in the use of a broken cup that slowly gets reassembled as the week progresses. It's a bit surprising to learn that Roger Ailes, who later became CEO of Fox News had been a producer on \"The Mike Douglas Show\", but mostly we are amazed that given the times (Nixon, etc) that a popular network show allowed Lennon (only age 31 at the time) so much freedom to spread the message of the 'movement'. And if you are wondering, the week provided terrific ratings. For those paying attention, the similarities between then and now are quite clear.Opening in select theaters on October 9 (John Lennon's birthday)",

Regrettably, video coverage of some of the pianists, notably the winner (a Chinese Canadian) was not available probably due to a lack of legal agreement. I would assume that another film company held the rights to that. Imperfections aside, the docu had the confidence to just be itself with all its omissions, and was still a great work.

However, how many did not pass by there?

The world is obviously designed to maintain a certain social class. We witness the \"Missing People\" reveal themselves in a montage esque fashion, to perhaps show their worthy or unworthyness, depending on the viewers ideological values.This event was a majestic one if you understand what a director like Béla Tarr wants to emphasize. The event was filmed and shown in the same location, so obviously the exclusivity of a screening that will only exist then and there adds to the atmosphere. After the screening, the screen goes up and another room is revealed, there we can order drinks while listening to a angelic woman playing accordion music in the style of Mihály Vig and watching the faces of the \"Missing People\". Out of nowhere Béla Tarr shows up and greets the guests.",

Colonialism and the historical injustices in Africa have been well-documented in the past and the filmmakers are brave to create an powerful and frustrating story about the issues of colonialism and how it effected the country.Throughout, the camerawork is gorgeous with beauty landscapes and the natures of wild life Africa. Many of the conversations between the participants felt genuine and emotional to observe and some of the information that were explored was pretty frustrating. However, as much I did enjoy the documentary, I did wish I liked it more because I personally felt some of the concepts and conversations weren't as strong enough and some of the pacing did kind of dragged along. As there were certain components that felt could have been improved and be focused a little more.Nevertheless, I applaud the filmmakers for being brave to tell the stories of the harsh realities of European colonialism and the effects it had on Africa.",

The Variety review linked from IMDb gets it backwards: the film is not aimless, but open -- as if it enters the void occupied by the ex cult members on the screen. Nor is the film limited; rather, it's intriguing. It hints at horrors so enormous that the viewer is inspired to contemplate what life in The Family must have been (and still be) like. The direction and editing are of unusually high quality for a cable documentary; the entire presentation is feverish, fractured, and consistently dynamic. It's inspiring to know that this movie was helmed by a former member of the cult, as its electric vitality suggests that the director's spirit escaped intact.Of particular interest -- however superficial -- is the fact that all the former cult members on screen are good-looking. This sounds like a silly thing to say, but I suspect anybody who watches the film will notice it. Are the members aesthetically pleasing because the leadership chose attractive people to participate in The Family's sexually charged lifestyle? In any case, it's unusual to encounter -- be it in a documentary or in real life -- a concentrated group of people with this level of charisma and aesthetic appeal. Watch it and see.A truly novel, memorable, and revealing piece of work.",

Interesting to hear the thoughts of the rescuers who had to anaesthetise the boys before they were taken out of the cave.

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. Cinema trends often mirror societal trends (Superheroes being the exception), so it's not surprising that so many movies over the past few years have dealt with dementia and Alzheimer's in some manner. In fact, it was just 3 months ago that I watched Maite Alberdi's Oscar nominated documentary, THE ETERNAL MEMORY, and it was only three years ago that Florian Zeller's THE FATHER won two Oscars. As the population ages, physical and mental limitations become more prevalent, and it's the cognitive difficulties that are causing the most challenges for caregivers and medical professionals.Max Lugavere and Chris Newhard co-direct this documentary that focuses on Max's mother, Kathy, who is displaying all the symptoms of dementia. The film opens by showing home movies of Max as a kid, and Kathy as an energetic, fun-loving mom. When it cuts to today, we find Kathy's once lively, twinkling blue eyes are now hollow and lifeless at age 63. She's chronically tired and her phone conversation with son Max shows her memory is slipping. Max co-authored the book, \"Genius Food\" with Paul Grewel, and he meets with his Los Angeles publicist to inform her that he's moving back to New York City to spend time with his mother.What sets this film's approach apart from some others that broach the topic is that Max takes us on the journey with his mom as they explore possible options to improve her situation. It's explained that she's on a blend of Parkinson's drugs and Alzheimer's drugs, as that has been determined to be the best treatment for her Lewy Body Dementia - a cross between the two diseases. We are there as she fights with the doctor over the brain scan, and we sit in on some of the discussions with specialists in the field. Max tries to answer the question, \"Where did this come from?\", as there is apparently no genetic trail or were no early signs (other than a propensity to collect trinkets).It's at this point where knowing Max's background may affect one's perspective on the documentary. Knowing his public support for some trendy diets and the controversy such diets have caused, moves us away from the caring son and towards self-promotion. While it's difficult to disagree with the idea that diet and fitness are likely associated with cognitive health, he seems to quickly believe any study that agrees with his personal beliefs. It is interesting to hear the link between post-operative patients and Alzheimer's, but the 'adopt a dog' segment seemed a bit of a stretch.Many of us have experienced the impact when a loved one begins the slow decline from this silent disease. The idea of fixing the body first so the brain can recover is somewhat logical, but whether it's red meat, vegan, kimchi, or something else ... nothing has yet provided us with the glimmer of hope needed to reduce or slow the effects. Surely, some will benefit from Max taking the camera on the doctor visits and discussions with mom, but the self-promotion is a bit tougher to accept. Re-tracing the NYC locations shown in those home movies makes for a nice final touch.Opening in NYC theaters on April 19, 2024 and expanding at later dates.",

There were 796 baby corpses discovered in the Tuam sewerage system.How many baby bodies will be found in the other 43 institutions?The Sisters of Bons Secours, who ran these homes, systematically stole babies and adopted them out across the world and told the mothers nothing. The babies kept at these homes were starved to death if not adopted, and thrown down a sewer, with no documentation to declare their existence on earth.The Irish government and the Galway council have tried to cover this up and seal the records of an inquiry's findings, thus adding to the horrendous trauma the surviving children, now adults, have had to endure.The remains of the 796 Tuam babies should be excavated, identified and returned to the respective families. It's been stated it will cost 12,000,000 euros but the Sisters will only contribute 2,500,000 euros . Shameful, pay for your sins sisters!This disgraceful story of infant abuse and starvation and the slavery of the mothers, as well as the disgusting business plan of forced adoptions to fill the coffers of the filthy Catholic Church is beyond comprehension!ITS A WAR CRIME !!!In January 2021, the Sisters of Bon Secour made a statement saying that they were sorry that they failed to respect the dignity of the women and children and acknowledge that the dead babies (babies that they murdered) were buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way. WELL.....that's an UNDERSTATEMENT!The Catholic Church stands for murderous, heartless nuns and child-raping priests, all allowed to happen under the watchful eyes of the bishops, cardinals and the Pope! I feel certain that no amount of \"hail Mary's\" will prevent the filth of the Catholic Church from burning in HELL ! That's what I'll be praying for!Thank you to the documentary makers for shining a light on the black hearted Catholic Church, yet again!I wish all of the survivors of these atrocities happiness and peace for all their days.",

Journalist Greg Palast documents an under-the-radar system of suppressing the Black vote that has gone unchallenged and largely unreported. It began in Georgia under Gov. Brian Kemp and spread to the rest of the states, at a scale that may very well explain the surprising re-election of Donald Trump. A convincing argument is made that many or most of the voters struck from the roles are perfectly valid registered voters, many of whom have lived in the same house for decades. We hear from some of the victims, as well as from election workers and even some of the \"vigilantes\" who compiled lists of Black voters to challenge their right to vote by falsely marking them as deceased or having voted in another state.",

That took me a while, but then something happened. A bit like what sometimes happens with art; you no longer analyse the painting, but literally the 'art' enters you. That was the case now. Mother Earth 'was' there. Not in relation to a natural disaster, or how certain animals live, but really as herself. It seems that at such a moment a certain part of the brain is activated. The music certainly played a role in this.Maybe that was also because I had no frame of reference. I did not know how far we were from Earth, so I could not estimate the size of things. Very special. I was also aware that space travel contains the pinnacle of human ability. The greatest experts in the field of physics, biology, but also in dietetics and psychology come together to make their best contribution. That enormous concern to achieve the highest possible quality, that was also in the film. André Kuiper spent hundreds of hours selecting the most beautiful images and the best matching music and in a certain way that came across to me. I was literally in tears when the images of the reflection of the sun on water passed by. Wow, how unbelievably beautiful.Maybe a film for a special mood, but a must-see as far as I'm concerned.",

The daily life of those who dream of working in the world of the bullfighting ring . A movie that follows the pupils of the School of Tauromachy in Madrid. And especially focusing on a young apprentice who eagerly wants to dedicate himself to bullfighting while his father opposes him with all his might, while the latter beats him and treats him badly. At the same time the movie dealing with Spanish bullfighting , it is called Corrida De Toros (literally \"running of bulls\") or la fiesta (\"the festival\"). The film has great interest for fans of bullfighting because being a summary of the typical and well built screenplay upon very young bullfighters who emerging from anonymity, seeking his opportunity, in ¨Becerradas¨ and ¨Capeas¨ or \"clown-bullfighting¨ spectacles with El Chino Torero , to get a real fame and fortune. The rest of the film is bullfighting cuts that for those who do not like bulls , however, being some tedious .The boys in this film, between eight and 16 years old, all of them give naive acting , they are real students of the Madrid Bullfighting School in those years, dedicating their lives to this peculiar Spanish art , and for some politically incorrect today , concerning the world of bullfighting . Students learn to understand and love with patience, with mistakes, with love . Revealing the human side of the bullfighter : his emotions, sensations, and sacrifices. They don't just seek money and fame, they don't boast before their friends , they don't have behind them that mother who folkloric cinema fostered to the point of boredom. They live the illusion of the bull with a magical sense of glory. Contemplating these young people who dedicate their love to the myth, to Manolete, Juan Belmonte, Sebastián Palomo Linares , Manuel Benitez el Cordobés , Paquirri, each one is known in more detail, and that contact with their customs or hobbies transforms them into real characters with a dramatic approach. This bullfighting genre was very popular in the 50s and 60s that includes films as Solos los dos (1968) , Las cicatrices (1967) , Nuevo en esta plaza (1966) , Aprendiendo a morir (1962), Chantaje a un torero (1963) and the various versions of Currito de la Cruz : 1925 silent rendition , 1936 , 1949 and 1965 , most of them starred by real bullfighters as\nPepin Martin Vazquez , El Pireo , Rafael Albaicin , Manuel Carmona and Antonio García 'Maravilla'. But this ¨Tú solo¨ follows in the wake of ¨El momento de la verdad¨ (1965) by Francesco Rosi , a semi-documentary film , more than the style of the previous dramatic films. The motion picture was well written/directed by the prestigious cameraman Teo Escamilla.The movie gives a nice description about the culture of Spain surrounding the old traditions of the Toreador , while learning from little boys , teens and youngsters . Showing the classic figure of the Matador , in which Toreros are really submitted to nerves during slaughter . As the ancient Toreo art-form is described with unflinching and fetching realism , it is the story of bullfighters against brave beasts . The film gives a real description about ¨Bullfighting¨ art , as the bull is released into the ring, where he is tested for ferocity by the matador and Banderilleros with the magenta and gold Capote (\"Cape\"). This is the first stage, the Tercio de Varas (\"the lancing third\"). The matador confronts the bull with the Capote, performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull . Next, a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a Vara (lance). In the next stage, the Tercio De Banderillas (\"the third of Banderillas\"), each of the three Banderilleros attempts to plant two Banderillas, sharp barbed sticks, into the bull's shoulders . In the final stage, the \"the third of death\" , the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape, or Muleta, and a sword .",

We were convinced we could make substantial money together. However, everything changed when I attempted to make a withdrawal. To my shock, I found it was impossible. I had been scammed. What had once been a hopeful dream of financial growth spiraled into a nightmare, leaving me feeling helpless and betrayed.

I don't know why he was so determined that we know this, when the man had been hung by his arms, waterboarded, sleep deprived with screaming music , froze, and had multiple other horrid things done to him that sounded like torture . It reminded me of when John Wayne Gacy had killed like 35 dudes yet when interviewed he kept adamantly exclaiming that \"he wasn't gay\".They had a psychologist named Mitchell with no experience interrogating writing up basically torture techniques for interrogation. I am amazed they got him to talk about it on camera . They should have taken a tip from physicians and not to let psychologists do to much damage by limiting them to talk therapy only , they are not allowed to prescribe drugs , they shouldn't be allowed to prescribe so called \"interrogations \".This was well made but the content made me less proud of my country than I was before.

Paying for cuddling was a shock to me but not the disability sex work. I'm reminded of the movie, Mask, where his mom hired a woman to satisfy him for his first time. The need for pleasure is genetic. It's not the government's business if you choose to pay for it. On a final note, the silver daddy on the massage table is very attractive.

It is interesting to see a period you remember as history- it is and that's what happens when you get old! Like all good documentaries, the basis of it is the quality of research and contributors. I think it is important that young people see it too, to get a sense of what was going on in Ireland and Britain then. As with any film about the troubles, it is bound to stir up deep feelings and, so far as i can see, it is critisised for being too sympathetic to the hunger strikers and being too anti them by different people, as proof of that. I felt though that this was a genuine attempt to explain the hunger strike within its context and it succeeded. I remember, living in London at the time, the effect the IRA had, in terms of bombs, the constant news from Northern Ireland on the TV news and the effect the hunger strikers had- it was unsettling, the ultimate proof that nothing would stand between these people from their objective, however crazy starving yourself to death seems to most of us.",

She realizes that the only way out of this terrible reality is that women get educated and fight for their rights, but unfortunately this has become an impossible mission even in 2024.",

            "storyline": "The New York based artist Spencer Tunick takes pictures of nudes in public places  contrasting the naked bodies with the harsh architecture of the cities etc. Fed up of being arrested in New York for public indecency he decides to set out to go across the globe taking nude shots as well as doing group shots of nudes. With each country he gets different problems and benefits  the French are the most reserved, the Japanese afraid of losing jobs for being naked and the Australians barely need to be asked twice.I generally seem to have a problem with modern art because some of it deliberately tries to be controversial and actually have very little merit other than shock value. The argument that this type of art is good because 'it gets people talking and brings people to all art' is nonsense and never washes with me. However, I generally try to reserve judgement on things until I actually see it  hence me watching this film. I have already seen some of Tunick's work and was quite unimpressed by it, I didn't get the point and just saw it doing stuff that gets headlines. Watching this film I got an impression of the logistics of organising the shoots as well as the motivation of the people who had agreed to get naked. Other that this the film manages to deliver very little other than the interest/curiosity factor of watching lots of people pose nude in public places.What I wanted was insight: basically Tunick is given lots of chances to really talk about his work and his aims but he doesn't take any of them, only giving vague comments about his intentions  in fact he contradicts himself when he agrees with a South African's concept of his work (in order to get him to pose). As well as missing this chance to help us philistines understand his work, Tunick also comes over as selfish, rude, pushy and full of his own sense of self-importance. He insults people on the street and calls them 'rude' for walking past him as he hands out fliers (we all walk past these people everyday), he gets angry for the police for arresting him (accusing them of basically being idiots). When he is asked what makes his picture special, he replies 'because I took it'. The film only allows about three critically voices in the whole film  and all three of them are Australians who are given seconds to say a quick soundbite or two each. Contrast this with the huge amount of adoring voices surrounding him  only the head of the Russian Museum dares to question him, but even then she concedes to him. All those around him seem to hang on his every word and treat him as if he is doing the most important thing in the world. Even more insulting is how people who 'don't get it' are viewed  they are seen as idiots, the Japanese are openly attacked as being corporate drones.Those looking for critical insight will also be disappointed because nobody dares ask anything challenging of Tunick. Where does his money come from is what I was interested to know  he flies all over the world but then ends the film complaining about not selling enough pictures. He loves the media and he acts up for the camera, seemingly overjoyed at the chance to talk one to one to the camera. This greatly weakens the film's value  if you love his work and see him as an important artist doing important things then it is likely you will enjoy this. However if you dislike him or are unsure of your stance, then this will do nothing for you  Tunick shows himself to be lacking ideas and comes across as arrogant and self-important, completely wasting the chance to just honestly and without pretension say what his work is about.Overall this is an interesting film in terms of logistics and the chance to see unusual sight of lots of people getting naked in unusual places. However I came to it willing to be won over to Tunick's vision but only found a rather empty film that lost ant potential I thought it had. Novelty interest - yes; but artistic value or creative insight? No. (And, as an aside, what was with all the use of subtitles? The film uses subtitles for people speaking English! Understandable with one or two very thick accents but it also subtitles people in Australia and London! Did HBO an American audience would struggle with anyone not speaking with a raised inflection?!)",

Further, his photos are horrible. There is nothing special about them in the slightest. In truth, they are rather amateurish.I honestly believe I could do better.

Ismo is 3 years my junior, so we belong in the same approximate microgeneration, sharing it with the celebrity likes of Lauri Ylönen, Ville Valo or Kimi Räikkönen.The Ismo Film tries to show what a \"clown\" is made of, whether there are tears behind the façade of one. And - there are. A young Ismo used to cry to his mother that he is \"terminally shy; something which is father's (genes') fault..!\", thus accusing his mother of wrong paternal choice. But, he turned out alright in spite of this, come the blooming into that happens during college years, in his case in neighbouring university town Jyväskylä, which is the \"Athens of Finland\", maybe corresponding in some way to Athens, GA.Ismo knows how to woo the fastidious and fussy American audiences. Unlike American comedians, he does not dive into bigotism, cheap caricatures and class. His humour is about semantics. He dissects words from many angles, milks them for what they're worth (like rappers do?) and this way gets applauded by his audience. His \"ADHD\" brain makes all these connections that he forges between performances. So, in a way he offers a formula for becoming a standup comedian to those who could conceive of doing that. The downside of discoveries is that Ismo has a hard time going to sleep during his sleepless nights, and he dopes himself up with whatever pharmacies offer over the counter. Something young John Belushi might have confessed to as well... before AD 1983.This movie employs the \"hero's voyage\" narrative, known from literary theory, to divide Ismo's journey up into convenient bits - as if Ismo was Frodo in LotR. It is well cut, edited and narrated, often by Ismo himself. For all that, a lot of the immersion comes from trying to reflect how I myself would behave and feel in his shoes rather than watching his \"exploits\" mouth agape.Three stars off because Ismo keeps speaking over the end credits, something which is a cardinal sin. When the movie is over, it is over, and before that any stunts can be pulled, and the wool over the audience's eyes.",

I wonder if many young people will understand and really feel the emotions that this films evokes. So much has changed since I made my journey. Things I never thought would happen... happened.

Seeing how many of the cast and crew were able to come back was heart warming. I'm not sure I understand the bad review this received. I guess we all experienced Covid in different ways. We are senior citizens and we stayed home for almost 18 months. We didn't get Covid until we had been well vaccinated so our experience was mild. However, we were in pretty good shape before hand and have struggled to regain our physical stamina. These young people are so inspiring!

The mix of reenactments and archival footage keeps you engaged, and Namiq's account adds depth and complexity. It highlights the cultural and moral codes that influenced his actions. This film is a fascinating watch, showing how history can be shaped by unexpected individuals and their choices. Overall, \"Hiding Saddam Hussein\" is a fascinating watch for anyone interested in the nuances of human behavior under extraordinary circumstances.",

If you go, you want to be in a group of 4 or 5 and among friends who aren't competitive. You want backup when you say 'no'. As soon as you hit the door, the women are competing to see how much money they can get from you. They'll come over, chat it up, ask you if you want to go back to a room. Even if you say no, the meter is running just talking to you. They expect you to pay for their time. Oh, just came in to watch the pole dancing, or maybe the drinks, or gfb the food, doesn't matter. You're not there for free. Used to know this one high end stripper, turned bartender, turned wider load, and she wouldn't shut up about how she and another stripper would tag team to rip guys off. So typically these women lose their sex appeal over time and it's pretty common that they end up with younger guys who treat them badly, or much older sugar daddys. So didn't feel sorry for her at all when she got dumped; on a cruise. This isn't unique to vegas or even the US. You'll find the same among sex workers in japan only it's so it's so extreme and disturbing. Anyway, if you're trey parker, you can make a big splash and the girls will remember you but otherwise you're just a mark, a sucker, an easy grift. It wasn't always like that. There used to be some great strip places in vegas where pole dancing was an art and you could have a good time without feeling like you'd been molested but those days are gone. You can find much prettier women at the clubs, without all the baggage.Here's a true story. There once was a club in vegas that had several pool tables and a bar away from the main floor and they advertised things like poor tournaments and such. Turns out, these events were all staged to draw in locals but they weren't for the locals but mainly people in the industry that worked at other clubs. You thought maybe you were going there to play pool and the women would be all over you asking for tips and ignored the russian mob looking guys at the other tables. Didn't last long before the word got around and they closed. How do you not make money with a strip club in vegas? The women don't work for the clubs but rather pay the club to be there.And I don't know where they got these women but their not top shelf. My guess, some of the sleazier clubs around town way off the strip.",

These guys don't just climb; they sprint up sheer mountain walls without ropes, as if gravity were optional. Watching them practically run up vertical cliffs left me both awestruck and baffled. After all, I'm winded just walking up a hill.The two men couldn't be more different: Steck is serious, reserved, and trains relentlessly, while Arnold is a laid-back natural, seemingly more interested in the thrill than the rigor. Steck set records on three of the Alps' most challenging north faces, only for Arnold to follow and eventually outpace him on the Eiger, sparking a media-fueled rivalry that's as intense as their climbs. When Steck later claimed a speed climb on Annapurna - sans photographic proof - controversy nearly derailed his career. Nevertheless, he returned to reclaim his Eiger record before tragedy struck, bringing his extraordinary journey to a heartbreaking close.The documentary makes a compelling point: despite climbers' claims of doing it \"for themselves,\" it's clear they're as drawn to the spotlight as they are to the mountains. In a world where every feat is meticulously documented on social media and consequently sponsored, the thrill of \"doing it for the rush\" seems a bit questionable. Still, while I can't deny the fascination of watching them, I find speed climbing a bit too close to madness. Extreme sports might provide that adrenaline shot for those looking to escape life's mundanity, but maybe some risks aren't meant to be run up.",

I was so engaged with the film though that I switched to just English subtitles, that was better but found the subtitles weren't on the screen long enough. So then I muted the film and just read the English subtitles. I was personally satisfied with the outcome.",

This documentary, which I found on Amazon Streaming, only gives the shortest glimpses of the passengers and their activities. Its focus in the 20-story ship itself, how it operates, the precisely choreographed arrival of supplies to begin the 7-day trip, the behind-the-scenes activities to make the trip successful and entertaining.Some of the gee-whiz items for me. The four engines generate 80,000 HP. They propel the ship plus they generate enough electricity to power 50,000 homes. The ship carries 5,000 guests plus 1000+ crew - cooks, entertainers, bartenders, laundry workers, servers - everything to operate a small city on the water during its week-long, 2000-mile trip. They have a water desalination plant for the swimming pools and other fresh water needs. A sewage processing and disposal system. Wasted food is processed to feed marine life while cans and bottles are compacted for later recycling. A theater that holds over 1000 and does three shows a night. Based in the Port of Miami, upon its return a Port Captain actually boards the cruise ship by ladder to safely steer it into its special berth. (I later found out this is a pretty standard practice for ports, and Port Captains are very well paid.)The only two things I wondered about but were not mentioned. What happens when an machine breaks? Do they have mechanics and other repair persons onboard? And what about police? Surely there must be the occasional altercation onboard, how do they handle that?Overall this is a superb, fascinating look at the aptly named \"secret life\" of one of the largest cruise ships.",

The father and manager of the group, Bob Cowsill, forced the young brothers and sisters to let the mother, Barbara, into the group, much to the kids' consternation. It worked as a publicity gimmick but the kids in the group reportedly hated singing hard rock songs like \"Hair\" with their mom; and hated the goody-two-shoes image the group got as a result of that; since they were trying to earn their cred as a legit acid/ alternative type band along the lines of Rolling Stones, Crosby Stills Nash or The Byrds. This is a far cry from the TV show scenario where the kids drag the mom into the group and she reluctantly agrees. Also; originally in the Partridge Family pilot script the mother's first name was Barbara; like Barbara Cowsill; but Shirley Jones' people demanded that it be changed to Shirley. And ABC's insistence to the Cowsills that Shirley Jones star as their mother is part of why they refused to participate in the TV show; and why the title was changed from \"The Cowsills\" to \"The Partridge Family\".",

After watching this, I don't know what to say.This isn't a documentary and I'm really embarrassed for the crew. How come they published this? Are they not ashamed?I have read The Third Pole by Mark Synnott. It's the book about this expedition and I liked it a lot. If I remember correctly, he describes that they had problems with the sherpas because they wouldn't allow them to search or go off rope and they would only help them go up the mountain, if they summitted. So they had to change their mission, they had to make it look like they want to summit. This made sense to me, especially because there was a notion of the Chinese removing Mallory's and Irvine's bodys etc. But actually summitting wasn't necessary I think, they could've blown their cover the moment they were at the search site and this film makes this as obvious as it can get. Sure, they may had to descend on their own, but who knows if the sherpas would actually left them there on their own.And why is this whole thing about not being allowed to search for the bodies not covered in this so called documentary? Is it even true? After watching this, I don't know anymore.",

Interview the only person that was found guilty, the lawyers, the bank? Integrate the small world of hackers to get some insights? Think again. It's hypothesis after hypothesis. Fill the blanks with endless random images representing futuristic network connections around the world along with stressful music, you're done.The result is what we're all too used to by now; something that looks like a high tech commercial predicting the end of the world by computers, buttered with blend statements on cyber-threats that everyone's well aware of, while watching video clips straight for the Netflix free bank of computer related imagery.

Up to that point Caligula had been a sly leader, rewarding key constituencies to solidify power, but he was not bloodthirsty. It was after the illness that the reign of terror began.This documentary does not even mention that maybe the high fevers that Caligula endured during his illness might have induced brain damage that caused his behavior to so radically change. Much of this documentary seems focused on being a Caligula \"sanity apologist\" on showing how what he did that seemed cruel and insane actually had a point about retaining power and I just disagree. Making your favorite racehorse head of the Roman senate and ordering your troops to attack the ocean is just full scale goofiness.One interesting point that this documentary brought out that I had not heard before? The tall obelisk that Caligula had brought from Egypt still remains and stands intact...in front of the Vatican...with a cross on top. An interesting mixture of cultures and religions, is it not?This is probably worth watching, but even though the historians seem credible I think the production shows that even documentaries meant to inform have become somewhat infected with the sensationalism of reality TV.",

Due to indecisiveness and ineptness at the highest level, 24 of those merchant ships were sunk, a maritime disaster of monumental proportions.Narrated by Jeremy Clarkson, this is a very well researched and presented telling of a naval disaster and its causes. Includes interviews with survivors of the merchant ships plus crew on the escorting ships and historians.Clarkson does a good job at telling the story, though sometimes his way of telling it seems a bit populist, rather than factual. A minor issue though.Good use of locations to aid the audience's understanding and engagement, eg Clarkson travels on a ship in the Arctic to show how cold, dangerous and bleak it is.",

As a resident of Dallas, Texas at the time of Amber's abduction, I clearly remember the news coverage, but had no idea of the background story of the family. This doc fills out the picture fully, and is a fitting tribute to all those touched most deeply by Amber's life and passing. The death of any child is heart-wrenching, but at least one child has left behind a legacy that will live on and has already proven to be the savior of so many other children.",

It's simply following some first world sick people as they attempt to heal themselves using herbalistic traditions in Peru.So to that point, the film was kind of boring to watch. I wish there was a little more history about herbalism or the people of the area. But the film is simply interviewing and following those who in their little camp. The healers and the sick. 8 people and a few shamen (and a budding shamen).It was cool to see what could happen in this setting. In the thick of the jungle rather than an expensive resort or meek hospital. I think this film can give people a realistic perspective. The treatment seemed to work for things that we already know is reversible/salvagable such as type II diabetes, IBS, mental health issues and some neuromuscular disorders. If I had these problems and couldn't find an answer -- this would also be my last resort and I would take the chance!Unfortunately, as we could all predict, this stuff didn't seem to help more serious conditions. But if I had a cancer, did everything I can, and was just at my wit's end -- a trip such as the one documented would definitely change my life perspective and would be worth while. Not necessarily for my disease, but just for myself as a human who desires self-actualization and to live the rest of my life with rich, beautiful perspective!I give this 6 stars. It wasn't too bad. It was authentic. Can spark some conversations. And the point was to reveal that there is no \"science\" to this, which is unfortunate. The creators hope this film can encourage MORE scientific documentation on healing arts. I wouldn't give it more stars because it's not exactly a thriller. I would only watch this when bored (which I did. watched while I was cleaning my room). Wouldn't make the intent to watch this for fun or educational purposes. Only if I were leading some sort of healing arts conference or class or something.yep. That's my 2 cents.",

Not one time. You would think that if there was such things occurring in the house then there would be plenty of evidence (not just hearsay and not just the word of the owners saying they experienced anything). But, there is not. Just a bunch of people sleeping, running around with cameras and finding absolutely nothing.Save your time. Save your money. Save your sanity and skip this drivel. They could have at least added CGI and special effects like all these ghost hunting shows to make it more interesting, but no. Even Ghost Adventures has at least something in it worth scratching your head over. This had nothing. Just a music box which could easily be explained and another monitor in the attic that could also be explained easily. Defective equipment. I can't tell you how many times my Playstation went off by itself. It wasn't due to a ghost not liking that I was beating the Dodgers 3-1 in baseball, it was due to the fact that it has spotty firmware/software and perhaps my Playstation 4 was overheating.These things can easily be explained naturally, not supernaturally. Orbs? Dust. It's almost always dust. Or an insect near the lens. But a spirit? Seriously? No, it's dust, or an insect. I think people want it to be something supernatural so much that they will say anything to help them believe that it is. \"I heard the floor creak! It's a ghost!\" No, it's just the house settling.

The film spans several years, and shows their changing relationship as they sometimes uncomfortably deal with the truth. I saw this documentary at True/False Film Fest with a sold out house. The Director was there, and answered many questions afterwards from the audience. If she chooses, she should have a bright future in filmmaking. This is a remarkable accomplishment and well worth viewing.",

It also shows how there were 4 people murdered that day, all unarmed, and 3 outside of the capital building. It is a continuing disgrace to our country as these mostly peaceful protesters are being put in jail for years for just attending this event while the hundreds of thousands of BOM and antifa Protesters have been much more violent and are not being arrested. When they are arrested you have more ones like the vice president who bailed them out. It is now Going into 2024 and we are learning more and more each day about how Nancy Pelosi withheld 40000 hour's a video that proves that she was behind this plot to discredit Trump and his followers. We know now that AOC was lying when she said that she had PTSD from being there because she was actually a few blocks away in her office. We know now that the whole fire extinguisher murder story was 100% fake. We know now that many of the doors were unlocked from the inside and held open by security guards smiling and taking selfies.

I'm not a \"hater\" and I really do think they're both deservedly two of the biggest comedians / comedy actors in the world right now!....... BUT.... This just isn't something I feel ever needed to be made! I enjoy Documentaries and having a reputable journalist create a Biography is often really enjoyable to watch / read if done the right way, you shouldn't however make a Documentary on yourselves which seems exactly what these guys did here. It's basically an hour of Chris and Kev talking about how great they both are, inserting snippets of friends talking about how great they both are and how they're both only getting more great every day! As an American I understand this might be your cup of tea! As a Brit myself it made me almost throw up in my mouth it's so self serving and ego driven! We get it guys you're both super successful!?

Sure. It is healthy to consider the ideas and arguments from across the political spectrum. But, it is not healthy for a film to not disclose is purpose = to garner and persuade public opinion to support an institution that serves the conservative agenda for the foreseeable future. It is also important to note that this film plays \"the race card\" in that it sells the Electoral College as an institution that benefits communities of color. Not only is that a lie. It is low key offensive that they included this point. In fact, the Electoral College drastically gives far more power to the single vote of a white American as compared to the single vote of an American of color... in fact, this is the primary issue that many modern critics of the Electoral College have-that is, that it concentrates power in white people, and systematically disenfranchises people of color. Of course you should watch it to be familiar with arguments that you may hear, but don't let these folks lie to you and provide you with false information without knowing what you're watching.",

As the movie progressed I heard a message of why are we tolerating this behavior in our country, and the media. There are lessons for parents to learn from this film that would be valuable for sons and daughters to learn from a healthy perspective. Hopefully once people begin to not respond to the social media influences that rive our society our children can be protected from the behaviors that are depicted in the film. A great documentary, I am excited to see what the producer does with the feedback from the movie in the future.",

But, with lots of young folks who were born after the fall of the Iron Curtain, much of this film might come as a surprise--and it's a wonderful history lesson about these tense times.Mark Spitz (yes, THAT Mark Spitz) narrates this documentary about the 1956 Hungarian Olympic Water Polo team and their match-up with the Soviet Union's team. However, before discussing this, the film spends a lot of time explaining the failed 1956 Hungarian revolt against the Soviets. All of the information is well presented--with the usual interviews and film footage. And, in addition to talking about these events, the film ends by showing a reunion of the team--along with a few members of the old Soviet team. I really liked this part--especially since it provided a bit of hope and a nice conclusion to the documentary. Overall, very well done, interesting, uplifting and well worth your time.",

This captivating story is told in full from its humble origins in New York house parties, to its metoeric rise to mainstream popularity, to its precipitous fall from grace at the turn of the 1980s. The film tells this story by expertly interweaving interviews with the people who were largely responsible for creating disco with archival footage from the 1970s. Often the filmmakers will intercut interview with footage of the exact events their subjects are recollecting. The effect on the audience is to make one feel completely immersed in this lost world of the golden age of disco, and want more than anything to be able to travel back in time to experience it first hand. At times funny, at others tragic, and always highly engaging, Disco's Revenge is nothing short of one of the best music documentaries ever made. Plus, as one would expect, it has a killer soundtrack.",

A particularly impactful moment was when a feminist questioned Francia about her stance on feminism. Her clear and thoughtful response personally earned my respect. Francia emerged as a woman who wouldn't let external influences manipulate her.It's remarkable that, without big financial backing, she gained widespread support, attracting numerous young volunteers.

If the director spent half his time worried about the plot line and less about the bulging veins in the giant cow, we might have had a salvageable moment.

Also, oftentimes the interview topics felt like they were sometimes taken out of context and shoehorned into the narrative the director/producer wanted to portray, which subequently threw off the pacing as well. An example is Sven (no spoilers) being an extreme radical, and their example is a DDoS attack... which is childs play for hackers. Yeah, he committed a DDoS attack, but in terms of hackers thats childs play. If people knew how vulnerable their private information truly is, they would probably advocate for more privacy and security (I found this out the hard way when my identity was stolen), and yet governments are trying to BAN encryption! The movie definitely seems to advocate for a 1984 style \"big brother must see everything to keep us safe\", when people like us law abiding citizens are the ones that get affected the most... Im sure you've all noticed criminals don't care that they're committing crime, therefore its only going to affect us normies. The straw that broke the camels back, us they don't just insinuate but the outright explicitly say he's guilty, and he hasnt been tried in court yet. That should be illegal, but im sure there's a loophole based on their regional laws that Netflix exploited in order to be able to do it.In summary, as a doc buff, I say skip it, unless you want to see if what I said was true. Its uninspired, 2X as long as it should be (or more), its like a made for TV crime show where 65% of the episodes are just repeating the same things, it explicitly calls him guilty when he hasnt had a trial. I mean there are more, but it was so bad I could write a pamphlet, and aint nobody got time for dat. Hopefully this saves some time for someone, or gives them a little better of what to expect without spoilers.",

He enjoyed working with her so much he asked her to buy out his partner and come into business with him. As equal partners, they set up a limited company and brought out the first issue of Kamera, a nude, figure-study magazine that hit newsstands in 1957. A huge success, it spawned publication of Solo, another monthly magazine. They also started producing their own 8mm glamour films, but after investing a large amount of money into it, they discovered there was no market for 8mm films and the studio floundered. They made this feature length film hoping to recoup profits. They didn't. It was only shown at one very small cinema and never had a general release. They were forced to dissolve the business.",

I saw a video on IG via a German news agency that bought some footage from BackGrid (the paps Meghan called to be there) and it shows NO chase at all. In fact, it shows exactly what the NYPD said - the SUSSEX team were the ones causing any issues and there was no chase. Their team blocked an entire street with their SUVs parked at a 45 degree angle blocking NYC traffic which is illegal. The cops were called by one of my fellow NYers & they came to tell them to move and out comes one of their team getting in the face of the cops (not a wise move in NYC) trying to tell them some invented drama & the cops aren't buying it & tell them it's illegal to block the street, there was nobody following them & the photographers Meghan called were on the sidewalk filming it. Nobody was paying attention to them, nobody cared, nobody followed them. It was THEM that created the drama & tried to spin a false narrative to say they're in danger or being stalked so they could try for IPP status where all taxpayers pay for their security. Everyone in NYC knew the story was fake because it's physically & logistically impossible to have a chase in NYC.",

It allows you to feel or experience being there, rather than being interrupted every minute by a host voice. Good job.The whole account really touched me. You know you hear about these kids, but was interesting to actually see their lives. What really bothered me is how few citizens actually stopped to help or talk to the kids; most just ignored the kids. Each time Ana cried, tears began with me. I just wanted to reach out, but couldn't through the TV. Grrrr.This docu is worth watching, but somewhat emotionally tugging. Would be a good documentary to show in middle school, to remind kids here in the West just how lucky they are.Mostly, it served as an inspiration reminder to me of why I like to help others. Which, as I am finding, is often a very lonely road versus my friends who only like to spend their spare time at nightclubs.",

It reveals how London becomes their hub for buying properties, taking legal action, and starting anew after their downfall.What sets this documentary apart is its focus on a developing country's fight to reclaim stolen money from Britain. It showcases the determination of those challenging the system and demanding justice.The film combines powerful storytelling with compelling evidence, educating viewers about corruption's complex web. It raises important questions about the responsibility of financial institutions and governments.I highly recommend this documentary to anyone seeking insight into corruption, offshore finance, and the pursuit of justice. It's a wake-up call that urges us to advocate for transparency and accountability. Get ready to be enlightened and moved by the hidden truths behind power and wealth.",

It shows one year in the life of the community, bookended by a couple who live there year-round, and sub-bookended by the liquor store's opening and closing for the season.Characters of all ages appear in the film, but there is a bias towards older folks, who can reminisce about the 70s freedom followed by the losses due to AIDS. This allows various archival material to be introduced. The community has gotten more diverse, with Black and trans members, led by a Black trans activist. There are still questions of social class, as to who can afford to own or rent there. However, the most visible are still the younger partying crowd.Today, what threatens Fire Island most are the effects of climate change. Rising sea levels are less of a concern than storms. Sandy is mentioned as washing away most of the beaches. Just before the annual big beach party, a piece of beach disappeared overnight, requiring a reconfiguration of the dance floor, and an abrupt stop to ticket sales. However, there is mention of government support in rebuilding the beaches, knowing that if Fire Island is allowed to wash away, Long Island will be exposed to the full force of the Atlantic.The is one brief scene with a guy wearing a tank top with the movie title on it. I don't know if the title was taken from the shirt, or that was a planted scene.",

Whether you agree with the actions that national governments took to fight the outbreak is not as important as knowing on what basis these decisions were made.

In instances where there is a Tiger causing problems and fear, they have a process to move the tiger to a safe environment where they will not come in contact with people.The film is beautiful and includes rare and unique scenes of majestic Tigers (and other animals) in family groups never before filmed at such close proximity. There are no scenes of killing or other activity that could be inappropriate for younger viewers and provides educational content as well as aesthetic cinematography. My only complaint is there was no follow up on the young male who was injured in a conflict with another Tiger. It left me with lingering concerns and I would have appreciated confirmation that he recovered fully.The dedication of this group and the country in general is impressive and this film is a testament to their dedication, commitment, and success.",

Any person who dresses up such actions as these in the name of religion does not warrant any place on this earth at all in my book.Praise indeed to the people who tell their story of survival and the people behind piecing the footage together. The resultant viewing is.... well beyond words, and even this review to me can never reflect the disgust for parts of the human race. How? Why? Why hurt, kill and subject people to such horrors?Well done to the makers. Thank you for telling a story which needed to be told.For those who survived; I cannot imagine your thoughts, the terror and sense of hopelessness when facing such a display of brutality. I only hope you lives now are peaceful, full of love and you're able to live as good a life as you possibly can after this.",

I suggest that all of you also watch \"Where is the Friend's House\" movie. At the end of seeing these movies by Kiarostami, you are happy that you didn't waste your time, and I think that is because he shoots from the heart. The depth and sincerity in Kiarostami's films truly touch the soul and leave a lasting impact.

There's a lot of serendipity and luck. We both had our first jobs in Texas. He was in Galveston as a weatherman and I was in Archer City as a location manager on The Last Picture Show (1971). Our careers, in a funny way, have kind of paralleled in interesting ways, being in the right place at the right time. But the biggest challenge, I just said, is tons and tons of archival footage, what do we use, those choices, all the people in Dan's life, and how do we encapsulate that into one movie. It's really choices, but hopefully, I made the right ones.\"",

            "storyline": "This film about Blood, Sweat & Tears not only reignited my love for their music but also unlocked intense childhood memories. When I was around five years old, my parents played their album constantly, and I would dance around the house, completely immersed in the rhythms and melodies. Watching this documentary, I discovered so many songs I hadn't heard before, and I was blown away by the depth and diversity of their catalog.As an adult, I've gained a new appreciation for the band, especially their brilliant fusion of jazz and rock, which was so original for its time. Their unique sound places them at the top of my list of favorite bands from that generation. The film also captured an interesting and poignant chapter in their history-touring Eastern Bloc Soviet countries. Watching how their music uplifted people living under such oppressive regimes was incredibly moving. It underscored the power of musical expression, especially in places where freedom of speech and creativity were severely restricted.Reflecting on that, I couldn't help but feel a sense of concern about the direction America is heading, particularly under Democratic leadership. The lack of freedom of speech and expression (and propaganda) is becoming more evident, echoing what history has already shown us. This film, beyond being a tribute to the band, serves as a reminder of how essential music and freedom are to the human spirit. Blood, Sweat & Tears not only entertained but also embodied that powerful expression, making this movie both an emotional and thought-provoking experience.",

It was just a good multimedia work of art in the art gallery, and it became a pioneering attempt in the theatre. Maybe 80 minutes is the key to achieving its pioneering nature? In addition, are the barriers of theatres and art galleries really so obvious and must they be broken?But anyway, Tsai Ming-liang can think of it, can do it, and let everyone see that the film itself has a relatively positive meaning. The movie is a walker series, which is more like an ascetic here. The Buddhist scripture, which is the source of the name of the movie, also explains the content of the film well, that is, do not pray for the result, just do it with your heart.",

This documentary attempts to trace how the film was made, what exactly happened to it, and oddly, although it might appear to be IRA propaganda, whether British or American intelligence had any role in its making. It also catches up with some of those featured in the movie, who are mostly unrepentent of their actions. In the overall story of the Troubles, it's a minor affair, but the footage recorded is still a compelling and scary reminder of what can happen when a government is perceived by many to have no legitimancy. Whatever its original purpose, it reminds us now of how fragile, but precious, peace can be.",

At times, it will seem like Dax is putting on a persona, but in my humble opinion, I believe that Ian was able to capture the pure untethered energy of Dax in all of its awkward, genuine, glory.

            "storyline": "I have been reading and watching videos on this topic for a few years now. It's exciting that a documentary like this can bring the information to a wider audience. I sure wish Dr. Mew had treated me when I needed orthodontic help! I'd be a different person now. I was one of those typical kids with an overbite who had two top teeth pulled and the top teeth pushed back to fit my receding chin.I really feel that being \"ugly\" has harmed many of my opportunities in life. I try not to spend time regretting it, and of course my true friends love me as I am, but I was constantly picked on as a child, looked down on as a teen, and am usually disregarded as an adult. I've never been married and I think I might have been if I were a bit prettier (not discounting the fact that many people more homely than I are happily married...so who knows?). Being ugly does a lot for your character, of course, and I wouldn't want to be extremely pretty either, but I'd like to be closer to average.The sinus problems, mouth breathing, snoring, etc. Haven't been a great experience either. Thankfully I discovered mouth taping 8 years ago and noticed immediately that I felt more refreshed in the morning. Still not great, and I recently decided I should get tested for sleep apnea (hasn't happened yet). But the cool thing is that mouth taping at night retrained me to the point where I realized maybe 4 years ago that I don't mouth breathe during the day any more. My normal relaxed position now is with my mouth closed, which brings many benefits. Before, it was simply impossible to keep my mouth closed without thinking about it constantly, and it wasn't comfortable. I'm 58, but I can even tell that my teeth have shifted. I'm not sure yet where this will end up, but I'm not going back to mouth breathing! Now I need to get serious about learning to mew. I'll try the Mews' (fairly new) app on my phone when I get a chance.",

And with Peace comes also Love and Patience and Humility. And for these no effort is too big, and nothing else matters.These men live in the Light of God, and it is He that gives them everything, so they feel at home and fulfilled.May we all be blessed with a bit of their Peace of mind and heart, and may we all find true Love, above anything.

This film is simply a sit down with John as he tells his story for 1h42m.I was surprised at how rudimentary the production was. B-roll is dull, repetitive (we see the same photos over and over again), and the acted portions (to illustrate scenes in John's relationship with his dad) are poorly produced. The actors look nothing like the people they represent and even the ages and body shapes don't come close. In the hospital scene, the actor looks like a healthy middle aged man, representing a 90 year old man dying of cancer. He wears cheap glasses whereas all the photos indicate Mr. Robbins always wore designer glasses, little things that make the illustration not work.All that aside, I could not stop watching for one simple reason: John is so well spoken and his story so compelling that I could sit for hours and just listen to him. Thankfully the sound is very good and the scene of John speaking is well filmed. Would you take two hours of your time to sit down with a brilliant man and hear him tell his story?

The movie opens with a woman in the audience who was upset by the play, clearly distressed, and yelling at him about how he doesn't understand the challenges that she has been through in her life and felt blamed for being white. He responds to her by saying that the play is not about her but \"just about these eight people up here.\" He then goes on to say that it is \"a metaphor\" but \"just about these eight people,\" seemingly to be momentarily forgetting the meaning of metaphor. After the woman storms out, he mocks her to the entire audience.He offers insights into the depth of his thinking with soliloquies along the lines of, \"Theater is, like, my life, you know. Like I breath it and live it, and like it is everything for me, and, you know, like, theater is, like...you know?\" He talks about how he reads all sorts of random things online and has \"like a million tabs open all the time,\" implying, somehow, that this is evidence of his profundity. He speaks with an air of thick pretentiousness, like a first year college student gracing their audience with their nascent socio-political awareness. He is able to defend his incohesive and mostly incoherent thoughts and arguments by presuming that anyone that disagrees with him just doesn't understand the world at his level or feels threatened by his work, the laziest of all rhetorical defenses. His entire presence seems to be rooted in his deep fantastical longing for fame and praise and recognition, thinly veiled in some sort of social-justicey charade, all of which ultimately does a deep disservice to any real efforts to fight injustice in the world.",

Which just doesn't have the same glamourous and dangerous image as rock does, so it's simply not sellable to a young audience. And there are very few young people in this documentary.Unlike many docs this does not go into a massive deep dive into childhood from birth, but instead focuses on the career. Which is a welcome angle.The documentary is enriched by audio of interviews and hand written notes from the artist discussing her music, in particular tracks which have significant resonance.This artists story is very common however, as they say that on a record label, 90% of the artists never make it, despite the label spending on promotion. And of the 10% who do, they feel they should have been paid more, based on sale. However that money went on the other 90% of artists hoping they would make it. She was firmly in the 90% in terms of popularity. Her issue was her style of music didn't have the commercial edge and a record label is really just a band looking for commercial success.This artist had issues with heroin use and likely mental health issues, which were never really addressed in the doc, nor did it seem by her. She was injured badly in a car accident, however there was scant detail as to why. A common pattern for substance users is they will use, have a significant injury through an accident, then spiral back into heavier use. This to me seems hinted at but not confirmed. Thought its a well know phenomena if you have worked in this domain.While it is interesting to see that young people are taking to her music, its obvious that she could have been around today to see her new wave of popularity if she wasn't on drugs. Its hardly a spoiler as she passed away many years ago, like so many in the alternative scene.Certainly an interesting watch and may spur some people to go and listen to her music, but this is still another doc about an artist who has passed on who had no say in its making.",

Since then, he has not made any more BrickFilms, however his book remains available on Amazon. He has gone on record saying he will release the scenes he already had filmed, most of which have still yet to be released.

No Jimi Hendrix interviews either, we only get to hear and see the recording engineers who built and ran the studio with several Hendrix outakes of recordings that didnt make it to the album. And what bliss to hear those engineers recollect their memories of the birth of Jimi Hendrix' recording room in Manhattan, New York City.Jimi was always full of ideas which he couldnt immediately translate into work because of the incredibly expensive recording studios which already had costed Jimi a fortune. He didnt like the cold and soulless atmospheres of the usual recording studios either, hence his wish to build one of his own! And so he did!Jimi's input into the design was especially geared towards the lighting, because he wished to be surrounded by a warm atmosphere, hence his wish to have different light colors available for any mood he was into.A really fun and detailed look into how this magical Jimi Hendrix studio came to be. Highly recommended for Jimi Hendrix fans! And now I gonna listen to Electric Ladyland, which still blows my mind to this very day!",

The terrorists then spent hours in negotiations trying to get the pilots back, so they could be flown to Cyprus. Sometime near the beginning of the negotiations, they killed a passenger to make a point. This film then basically showed 90 minutes of nothing else happening until the end. I won't put any spoilers here, but I felt this could have been told in a more compelling way.

Defending herself against the man who attempted to rape her. Director Steffi Niederzoll masterfully combines interviews, smuggled footage, and personal letters to paint a vivid portrait of courage amidst an unjust system.The film's storyline captivates and angers, as it exposes the injustices endured by women in Iran's patriarchal society. Niederzoll adeptly navigates the intricate details of the case, offering a nuanced exploration of Reyhaneh's choices and the motivations driving those involved. The emotional impact of the film is undeniable, immersing us in Reyhaneh's world while we bear witness to the toll her imprisonment exacts on both her and her family.The performances in Seven Winters in Tehran are consistently impressive. Zar Amir Ebrahimi stands out with her profoundly moving portrayal of Reyhaneh, capturing her strength, determination, and unwavering spirit. The supporting cast of the film excels, each offering a unique perspective that enriches the story.Cinematographer Julia Daschner employs a vérité style that lends the film a sense of immediacy and authenticity. Handheld cameras and grainy footage create a sense of intimacy, drawing us into the world of the film. The film's soundtrack is also effective, combining traditional and contemporary music to create a sense of atmosphere and emotion.Seven Winters in Tehran is a compelling and poignant film that brings attention to the challenges faced by women in Iran. While its subject matter may be sombre, it serves as a testament to the indomitable strength and resilience of the human spirit. It fearlessly depicts injustice and celebrates acts of bravery. It may not resonate with everyone due to its deliberate pace and unresolved elements. Nevertheless, this worthwhile and significant work deserves attention.",

S. wanted music that was faster, louder and more intense, something that they could call their own. Hearing about and listening to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal but being unable to watch those bands live due to geography what did the kids do? Form band's of their own! Documenting this great and influential scene filmmaker Adam Dubin relives the origins and eventual breakthrough of the movement called Thrash that elevated Heavy Metal music to one of its most successful peaks both artistically and commercially.Blasting forth with the ascent of Metallica, the foremost band of the scene the film depicts a community of men and women who hung out, formed bands, jammed and partied like no other. With interviews of band members, friends, writers, label owners, scenesters, etc., the doc showcases a highly creative and vibrant scene that thrived on great music and a lot of beer and wanton destruction (and a whole lot of fun in doing so!). Images and archival footage show priceless photos and vids of great bands like Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, Testament, etc., hanging out and ripping it up onstage with rabid appreciative fans moshing and stage-diving in communal frenzy. Great music is the soundtrack and it's great to see James Hetfield, Dave Mustaine, Tom Araya, Gary Holt, Alex Skolnick and a host of others relive the glory days of their youth and the music. The fanzines and tape trading that were a huge part on why the music flourished are touched on not to mention the few ladies who were a big part of the scene including the one of a kind Debbie Abono who served as both manager and mother figure to the motley group of monsters.With its direct, no nonsense approach that gives off a cool, somewhat amateurish vibe, \"Murder in the Front Row: The San Francisco Bay Area Thrash Metal Story\" is an essential documentary on one of the most seminal and important genres in Rock history. This is one every crazed Rock fan and unhinged metalshead should watch and bang his head to. Two devil's horns up!",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness - from the Dallas International Film Festival. When people discuss the U.S. public education system, most agree (at least to a certain degree) that it's broken. The impassioned and creative debates occur over how best to \"fix\" it. The ideas are infinite, but as with any problem in need of a solution, it's wise to consider the desired end result. What do we need and expect of our education system? And who is \"we\" in that question? Are we satisfying societal needs or those of the individual  and who decides? It is not feasible to expect an 86 minute documentary to answer all of these questions and solve one of the biggest issues facing society, but skilled documentarian Greg Whiteley does his best to advance the conversation. \"Teach to the test\" is the widely accepted curriculum these days, and it's defined as daily lessons and assignments structured to prepare each student for the standardized tests utilized for determining a student's knowledge base, grading teacher effectiveness, ranking schools and school districts, and of course, determining the acceptability of certain students at particular colleges.With a basic structure that has not changed in 124 years, it seems clear that our education system is not properly preparing students for a world that has changed drastically in the past 3 decades. Many make the argument that the future success of students will be determined by what are called \"soft skills\": confidence, ability to collaborate, creativity, time management, critical thinking, and decision making. There are interviews from managers at Google and Khan Academy stressing that these are the skills they already seek in new hires.There are defenders of the current system. They claim it's all part of the game we play, and that students must survive the grind  just as their parents and their grandparents did. Opponents say students are being treated as data points, not people or future contributors. Whiteley takes us inside of High Tech High in San Diego. It's an experimental campus committed to finding new ways to teach, so that students learn and retain and accomplish. One of their most impactful evaluation points come from group projects that are presented to faculty, parents and the community. It's fascinating to watch the students work towards their goal, and equally interesting to hear the parents talk about personal growth of the students.Whiteley includes the spot on quote from John Dewey: \"If we teach today's students as we taught yesterday's, we rob them of tomorrow\". Though the film doesn't touch on the highly charged political landscape or the importance of teacher education and preparation, it is quite effective in generating thought and discussion about what responsibility we have towards students, and how we can improve the odds that they will grow into contributing members of society.

            "storyline": "Danger Zone is a fictional movie by the otherwise jobless amateur couple Vita from Poland, with her husband Kamil, funded mostly by German taxpayers, through their politically connected parents, Mama Zelakeviciute and Papa Maciej.The movie plot is simple: Vita and Kamil dream of being film makers and traveling to exotic countries, so they invent the story of a \"war tourism industry\", which in reality doesn't exist.Lacking any proof, they quote an unknown source from 2012 (!) that says \"war tourism is part of adventure tourism with an annual turnover of US$ 265 Billions (!) - and growing\".Sorry, that is like calling unicycling on a tightrope over the Grand Canyon a part of the \"global bicycle industry\", with an annual turnover of US$ 65 Billion. Growing laughter, hahaha.The snapshooters Vita and Kamil stumble from one filming mistake to the next script debacle to the next typo error, while they are safely guided through Afghanistan, Colombia, Karabakh, Somalia and Syria by real veteran travelers who have, over many years, earned the trust and respect of their local contacts. (But none of the protagonists gets credited in the film, strangely only used and abused by their first names, although some of them have well known names and CVs.)Despite all the efforts, and their claim of a \"huge war zone industry\", the two rookie reporters predictably fail to produce any footage of a real war zone, so they resort to cutting in some shotgun noise and tracer ammunition from other movies.To make things worse, the childless Polish couple seems to enjoy seeing children suffer, so they stage several weird situations full of child hatred: \"The babies are all guilty! The babies will all die!\". Furthermore, they even hand a real gun to a group of kindergarten kids in a Syrian refugee camp, and provoke a kindergarten kid to make a cut-throat gesture.The two Poles also display their country's stereotypical attitude against Muslim populations, so they stage several film situations that look like an aggessive Muslim mob to the unknowing film viewer. Defamatory words like \"terrorists\" or \"drug cartell\" are thrown around indiscriminately. As if the people in foreign countries were all criminal, savages and killers. So sad to see.The many successful peacemaking efforts of a Jewish couple, or the United Nations Organisations, or other voluntaryists, are routinely denied and cut out of the film story.The White privilege on display by Vita and Kamil, who seem to openly enjoy their atrocity p*rn, is sometimes hard to bear.In a sneaky way, Vita and Kamil try to project their complete lack of a life purpose, their own dark voyeurism, and their neurotic narcicism, onto their healthy film characters, but fail miserably.To unwitting television audiences, this fictional movie from Poland is sold as a \"documentary\" from the United Kingdom. As if there was a quality stigma of many things coming from Poland.The good news is that nowadays hardly anyone watches TV, and certainly not a film title like \"Danger Zone\", which has been used at least a dozen times before, and is practically impossible to pinpoint on Google. We recommend: don't bother.",

No real scientific evidence either, just a bunch of people complaining and drawing inferences.The doc seems to lack a proper direction and the writing or I guess the editing is just half baked - I am not sure how doc writing works, maybe it is more the editing .It appears that the filmmakers think they could ride on the importance of Nuclear Testing in a post \"Oppenheimer\" world and ride on the influence of some old celebs in the film who are vaguely connected to Nuclear tests.The music is pretty cool and it makes you feel like you are watching something real, perhaps temporarily distracting you from the lack of focus in this 90 plus minute.I liked some of the shots too and the old archives are always nice to watch but in the end this seems half baked and lacking in direction, vision or any real argument.Go watch \"The Day After Trinity\" or the PBS Downwind doc which do a better job if this topic interests you.",

            "storyline": "Food and Country was well-received at the SXSW Film Festival. It is an extremely well-research documentary that explores the nature of food production and distribution within US capitalist system. The film uses cases studies of smaller independent farmers, ranchers, fisherman and restauranteurs to explore the complexities of our food system. It shows how our system was structured historically to gradually consolidate food production into a oligopoly of large producers who are able to mass produce inexpensive food.This system has all sorts of implications. It reduces the quality and healthiness of the food supply. It undermines the business model of small farmers - and particularly small-scale African-American farmers. It negatively impacts the environment. It undermines small restaurants trying to produce healthier fare at reasonable prices. It also undermines the wage scale for workers in both agriculture and restaurants.Through a series of case studies against Food and Country intricately lays out all of these impacts on human life and health against the background of the pandemic in 2020-2021 which exacerbated all of these long-standing issues. It focus on the smaller scale solutions such as organic farming and farm-to-table production that cuts out the middle-scale wholesalers. It sets up, but doesn't fully examine ways in which the reform of the food system can produce greater economic and social justice in the broader society.This film does an excellent job of exploring the nuances of a very complicated and underexamined system. It is recommended for those who want to gain a more systematic understanding of how we are all shaped by what eat.",

There is a lot of great zoomed in footage which really lets you see these magnificent animals up close.Another strong point is the ever soothing voice of Sir Attenborough. He tells about the Orangutans with compassion and empathy, as though he were talking about his own grandchildren. It really adds to the good feel of the documentary.Weak points:\nUnfortunately, despite the documentary being fairly long, I felt that there was quite little information. It focuses mostly (too much) on their eating habits, which is a bit boring. For instance, I would have really liked to hear more about dangers (like predators and illnesses). Also, more information about their mating habits could have been interesting. Or perhaps more information about where they fit in the evolutionary tree of life. And some more information about how the humans close to their habitat are involved in the Orangutans' lives.Furthermore, I would have liked to hear more factual knowledge. So, instead of saying that Friska at 60 is one of the eldest there, there is no information on the average age or maximum age. Also, the narrator keeps alluding to the difficulty of making it as an adult, but no information on what prevents Orangutans from being successful (predators? Disease? Accidents? Hunger? Fights? Unable to find a mate? Humans? Climate?).Conclusion:\nAll in all, it is a well worth documentary to watch for the visuals alone, but I feel like they could have done more with the material.8/10.",

The filmmaker captures all the friction and struggle of being in a band without dipping into the typical rockdoc melodrama. Within the tension, there is humor and warmth.The film gets into the mythology that grew around the band - their brushes with success, their giving the finger to the establishment, etc. In doing so, it explores what defines success. There's a rock star success spectrum that spans from Quixotic self-destruction on the infrared end to sellout commercialism on the ultraviolet side. As the band navigates the shades of orange and yellow on the spectrum, we see them making these decisions that aren't necessarily in their best interest, but we are (mostly) totally on their side. And while they might not have become zillionaires or household names, they've done all right on their own terms.Their journey also reinforces this idea that to be anywhere on that spectrum (or most other artistic success spectra) requires singular, maniacal focus that most of us lack. But I'm glad that there are magnificent rock nerds like the McDonalds who have it.You don't need to know Redd Kross' music to appreciate this movie. It's funny, accessible, candid, and visually rich. I was riveted with a smile for 90+ minutes. This movie needs to be seen!",

They are the most succesful UK You Tube collective in existance; at the time of writing.I have watched their content and it is fun and easy TV to goof-off with late-at-night with a bowl of popcorn and a can of cold beer.It's got the Generation Z seal-of-approval and everywhere they go they get cohorted by crazy kids after a slice of the fame and the fortune.However it's quite self-indulgent and it is a bit long for what could essentially have been compressed into an hour. I got a bit tired of the format and as a documentary perspective it was not as fun as logging into the channel and just dropping out.There was some great information about mental health but they sometimes don't take things too seriously because they're too busy laughing to realise the actual message. I think they are maturing as men and are realising how important mental health is and advocating it to Generation Z and beyond is fabulous.I was also glad that they are doing charity work and an important aspect which is funding childrens' school trips. The Government don't do enough to help the poor and it's sad that famous people have to cover it. Austerity helps only the rich.It's nice to see these guys reach out to their communities and help others. It's a nice story and I wish them the best-of-success even though this documentary is a bit dull compared to modern produciton standards. Please get someone like Louis Theroux on for a professional angle.",

I was impressed with how honestly the movie showed how people learn to accept, exercise that acceptance to make it stronger, and how even if things make you feel uncomfortable at first, you realize it is simply because it is something you are not used to.Trans Santa meeting non binary kids brought tears. These children feeling free and open with their Santa broke a tension in me that I didn't know I needed breaking.Kid friendly (though it might lose their interest) and very intriguing to adults.A soulful and hopeful doc.

I disagree with some other reviewers in that this film does not not say other highly successful individuals not in the Olympics do not suffer as bad or that Olympians suffer worse than anyone else. This documentary is made by Olympians to help shed some light on their own struggles, and is being made for future Olympians to help them with their own journeys as they chase their dream.Narration and personal stories bring forth the widespread challenges members of the U. S. Olympic team face in their lives. Some have more sponsorships and post-Olympic opportunities while others do not.This film can be tough for the viewer especially if they or someone they know has struggled with their mental health. And even in this film, Steven Holcomb, who speaks of his own personal experiences with other athletes ends up losing his own battle while this film is still being made.This film is tragic and at times tough to watch if you can understand their mindsets. Since its release there has been progress made as Covid-19 has pushed mental health into the spotlight more but hopefully this film can at the very least serve as a teaching tool for all past, current, and future Olympic athletes regardless of their nation.",

Nancy Wake: the white mouse is one of the those docu drama's where people give \"their opinions\" of events alongside the dramatized story of Wakes time, in Nazi occupied Europe. Regrettably the \"insights\", such as they are, are clumsily interjected, breaking up the flow of the actual drama itself. Imagine someone talking loudly in a cinema, offering their view of events, while you are trying to watch a film and you get the idea. It would have been better, I believe, to have gotten the opinions out of the way up front and then move on to the story itself, without further interruption. The acting is alright as are the sets but the narrative felt a bit forced and stilted. The action scenes are quite well done and entertaining. In short, not a bad effort and to be fair, I suspect, on a nominal budget? That said, I felt, a lot more could have been accomplished with a simpler approach. Five out of ten from me.",

It features comments from all the band members, which all seemed recent other than the clips from Christine, who retired from the band around 1998 and seems to not want much to do with them now – so comments from her were from a back-catalogue. Really intriguing comments from Buckingham and Nicks (interviewed in different places as they don't really get on) citing how 'Dreams' and 'Go your own way' were their own personal songs about their imminent break-up – but with quite different messages.

If we used our waste for bettering us as a species instead of filling up landfills we are being negligent to the human race as a whole. The way some people are using this waste is unbelievable. It's used to make beer, feed the livestock which in turn makes the animal taste better and make them healthier as a whole. Most important it would stop hunger worldwide. In the richest countries on earth the hunger numbers are staggering. The people on the frontlines of this food waste are pretty amazing people. They find ways to turn waste into positives in every aspect of life. The waste that farms create is really eye opening. Over 50% of the crops harvested are even wasted . It seems that big corporations are starting to be more food waste conscious which is what needs to happen to make the ultimate change. Absolutely a great documentary narrated by the late great Anthony Bourdain. It's a great watch for children and adults alike. If we all are conscious of this problem we can help change this problem of wasted food, hunger, and environmental depletion. Food is a limited source on land and sea and if we are not conscious of how much we are taking and not putting back it will disappear in generations to come. Hope you enjoy this review !! Must watch.",

            "storyline": "\"God Knows Where I Am\" (2017 release; 97 min.) is a documentary about Linda Bishop. As the movie opens, we are at \"393 Mountain Road, Concord, New Hampshire\" and it is \"May 3, 2008\". The body of a woman is found in an empty house by a prospective buyer who was taking a look inside. It's not long before the body is identified as being Linda Bishop. The investigating cop cannot believe his good fortune that she left a diary of the last months of her life. It contains a letter saying: \"To whomever finds my body, I am a victim of domestic violence/abuse.\" The documentary goes back in time to Linda's upbringing and youth... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of long time documentary producers Jedd and Todd Wider (\"Taxi to the Dark Side\"). Here they bring the story of a woman whose death seems suspect. Was she abused? Was she on the run form the law? The directors do a marvelous job at going back in time, and the slowly letting things unfold, as if taking off lawyer after layer from an onion. Of course this film could never have been made without the extraordinary journals of Linda Bishop (who are read in a voice over during much of the film). This movie sheds new light on the incredible and devastating illness that is schizophrenia. Sometime in the film it is mentioned that there are 2.5 million people in this country suffering from schizophrenia, of which HALF deny that there is anything wrong with them (Linda Bishop was one of those). Linda's sister, daughter, and a slew of friends and others who know her are all interviewed at length. It all makes for a terrific, if very sad, documentary. \"Dear God, please save me\" are the opening words of the film (from Bishop's journals). And that's just the first emotional gut punch. Don't tell me you weren't warned...\"God Knows Where I Am\" opened out of the blue and without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Curiosity got the better of me, so I checked it out. So glad I did. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (probably the perfect weather had something to do with that). If you like documentaries, by all means do not miss this one but be prepared for a emotional wallop. \"God Knows Where I Am\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

            "storyline": "\"Manson: The Women\" (2019) lands a solid 3 stars in the galaxy of true crime documentaries, a commendable effort in a genre that's more crowded than a Manson Family reunion. The film does an admirable job at shedding light on the women of the Manson Family, showcasing their stories with the kind of detail usually reserved for Manson's more infamous, less hair-brained escapades. However, it's about as revolutionary as a spoon in a knife fight, serving up a familiar stew of archival footage and talking heads that could use a dash more spice.The documentary's strength lies in its focus, giving voice to the women who fell under Manson's spell, which is both its charm and its curse. While it's fascinating to dive into their psyches, the narrative sometimes feels like it's on a loop, a merry-go-round that can't quite find its stop. It's a bit like listening to your uncle recount his glory days with the enthusiasm of someone who's forgotten it's not his first time telling the tale. You're engaged, sure, but you're also eyeing the exits.In the end, \"Manson: The Women\" does what it sets out to do, albeit in a manner as conventional as Manson was unconventional. It's the documentary equivalent of a reliable family sedan: it'll get you where you need to go, but don't expect to turn any heads on the journey. For those steeped in Manson lore or newcomers curious about the saga's less-explored angles, it offers a solid, if not earth-shattering, viewing experience. Just maybe have a cup of coffee handy - for historical intrigue, not wakefulness.",

Other reviews criticise it for being one-sided, and it may well be if viewed from a wider perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but taken at face value, the interaction between Mosab and Gonen, that develops into a trust beyond blood, is an uplifting story that needs to widely heard.\nA solid documentary that, treated with care and sensitivity, could probably be turned into a powerful movie. This is a tale of hope.",

            "storyline": "Saw this at IDFA 2018, the International Documentary Festival in Amsterdam. For 2/3 of the running time it was a compelling array of footage about how crime was prevalent in the streets of Naples. It was the most natural thing to do, given the circumstances. People found they had no other choice, due to a lack of honest jobs. Even young children from the age of 5 were involved in shady activities, starting reasonably benign with selling cigarettes, gradually escalating to street robbery, because of knowing nothing else to survive and to pull their weight in supporting their family.The story lost me around 2/3 of the running time, at the moment we saw the aftermath of an earth quake. I was wondering what this and subsequent scenes had to do with the main story line. But it may be obvious for any Italian who has the necessary background information about it. I could imagine that it might refer to possible corruption with bad buildings as a result. I could not deduce anything from the subtitles.The dialog with the \"boss of bosses\", a title Raffaele Cutolo denies, may be illustrative. Even someone in prison for life can retain control yet still deny involvement in anything what happens \"outside\". 'He is open about helping someone finding a job, hence he is still powerful as per the conclusion of the interviewer. But the prisoner also downplays his influence as a \"boss\", by telling that it came down to writing a letter to a friend, so nothing suspicious in near sight. This Raffaele Cutulo remains a sort of Robin Hood in the eyes of the locals.All in all, I partly missed the things that (I assume) the film makers tried to bring across. It may be caused by not knowing some facts that are obvious for any Italian. Nevertheless, the movie is worth watching, due to the very interesting footage included.",

            "storyline": "The Walk is a deeply moving film that provides a poignant glimpse into the life of Asil, a young Syrian refugee in Turkey, awaiting documents while processing the trauma of losing her home and family. The film beautifully intertwines her story with that of Amal, a charming gigantic puppet who symbolizes millions of displaced children. Amal's journey from the Syrian border through Turkey serves as a powerful metaphor for the resilience and hope of refugee children worldwide.Through poetic voice-over reflections, the film delivers fundamental messages like \"home is where the road takes you,\" encapsulating the transient yet hopeful lives of refugees. The director skillfully balances the urgent narrative of millions of displaced children with an adult perspective, although the attempt to dive deeper into these complex emotions sometimes remains on the viewer to interpret.Despite this, the film's strength lies in its ability to humanize the refugee experience. Asil Elsepti's story, mirrored in the puppet Amal, highlights both the kindness she encounters and the harsh reality of anti-immigration sentiments. The juxtaposition of affection and hostility poignantly reflects the duality of a refugee's journey.The Walk succeeds in shedding light on the plight of refugee children with compassion and empathy. It is a heartfelt tribute to their resilience, reminding us of the humanity behind the statistics and the importance of extending our support and understanding to those who have been forced to flee their homes. This film is a must-watch for anyone seeking to comprehend the profound impact of displacement on young lives and the enduring spirit of hope that drives them forward.Hopefully, the real-life version of the traveling doll can become a constant European symbol of welcoming refugees, much like the Statue of Liberty in the USA.",

They have allowed the water ways to dump into oceans to \"save\" certain fish. Major cities did not decrease usage, while rural had no choice but to. Some like poor Porterville have no options...they are dry. It's a mess.

On the other hand, go see the film with friends and you'll be guaranteed hours of animated discussions around a drink afterwards. It's that sort of film.Told in beautiful shots of mountain landscapes and unintrusive portraits of the protagonists, the film tells us a story of how the reintroduction of bears in the Pyrenees affects local villagers, regional authorities and is used by some unsavoury characters to stir up trouble. There are bears, but this more about the people who share the mountains with the bears. One thing that you will definitely take from the film is a reminder that complex issues don't tend to have easy answers.The film is beautiful and intelligent in equal measure. The visible bond between the director and all the characters is visibly based on high level of trust. At moments you have to remind yourself that Yves, the shepherd is not a trained actor!Special mention also for the beautiful soundtrack and the production/editing.",

Showtime green lit this when we had just started filming and the delivery was shortly after knowing the outcome! It was interesting to edit along side the unfolding of the events.

The execution, however, is not so proficiently done and presented, with a sluggish pace and lazy camera work.The high rating is given for these two absolute legends of fighting against opression and prejudice.I was taken aback by their levity and hopeful posture in life and it is a great comfort for these troubled times we live in.Strong recommendation for anyone!",

It is a surface level, symbolic depiction of the Reagan presidency. You would think this many years later there would be a more in-depth look into the impact of his executive and legislative decisions particularly domestically. It also would've benefited from showing the other commentators. Instead the filmmakers decide to only use their voices.

This means having to sell assets not contributing to the bottom line, or closing 'underperforming' assets, laying off hundreds, and thousands. This is the legacy of this philosophy. This is why we've got terms such as 'rust-belt', fly-over country, and so on.This is why so many people are pushing for 'Stakeholder' Capitalism - take into account everyone effected by a job. Doesn't demand 100% efficiency, is more humane and spreads the rewards of a company more evenly.This showing makes him seem altruistic.

I wish I had the courage to raise my hand and say this during our discussion today.This film perfectly depicts how entrenched and deep-rooted the sexualization of children is in Greek society. The very questions posed to the victims to defend themselves are the same questions from which abuse originates. Parents, caregivers, and top-tier executives are all responsible for crimes happening right in front of their eyes by resisting and denying the truth-children (and especially girls) are not viewed as children.Ask yourself-when was the first time I felt like my humanity was exposed to the male gaze? Was it at church when I was asked to wear a skirt and be careful not to show my body? I was only 8. Was it when men catcalled me on the street? I was only 14. Was it when relationships between minors and adults were not only normalized but blamed on the victim and their poor mental or familial state? Was it when rape was discussed at the family table as an outcome of choices and not a crime? Was it when your high school friend dated a 36-year-old and it felt strange, but why talk about it? She is not a child anyway. Was it when you asked your father why he didn't protect you, and he said, \"Well, what was I supposed to do?\" As if rape and sexual abuse are not offenses, attacks and violations, but something almost natural -hard to go against. You're not a child anyway.Watch this film. Look at yourself and your children. Look at your students. Apologize to your younger selves and to your kids for what you overlooked. Fight for their right to be human, to be children-carefree and alive, humans of equal rights who need protection and guidance.Don't be afraid to call your self a feminist, a fighter for defending dehumanisation, in the face of a conservative and complicit society. No society is not hypocritical -society is a complicit.Watch this film to save your life or someone else's.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. I watch dozens of documentaries each year, and I always learn something from the best ones. However, I don't recall ever being so emotional over a documentary as I was while watching this one from Christian Taylor. Ms. Taylor confesses that she always considered herself a proud Patriot (her son serves in the US Army), but this is her film of \"the D-Day that changed me\" and where she \"truly learned about freedom\".The film initially focuses on Ms. Taylor's trip to Normandy for D-Day, and she comments on how the progression of the day bounces between \"celebration\" and \"memorial\" back-to-back. As the trip unfolds, it becomes something akin to a spiritual awakening for her. She mingles with the French citizens who have such vivid recollections of June 6, 1944. One lady is a particular standout: Dany Patix Boucherie. Dany was a 5 year old child that day 76 years ago, and we see the photograph of her wearing the American flag dress that her mom sewed from parachute scraps. To this day, Ms. Boucherie leads the cheers for the U. S. soldiers who liberated her town and country.We hear numerous personal stories from French citizens who were either kids at the time of the invasion, or they are re-telling the stories they've heard over the years from their friends and families. 20,000 French civilians died so why are they so grateful and respectful to the American soldiers who fought? Well we hear the answer directly from these folks, and the sincerity and heartfelt emotions are surely to hit you hard. At the heart of all the tragedy and destruction is an undeniable truth - the Americans were not there to conquer, but rather to liberate. That's the French perspective ... young Americans arriving in their country and fighting fiercely and courageously to prevent France from falling to the Germans.We see photographs of displaced French kids eating meals with soldiers at American camps, and smiling kids draped all over massive tanks to have their picture taken. Stories are told of the thunderous and destructive bombings, and of lost parents, but somehow the sadness was turned to gratitude after so many years.The Utah Beach museum was founded by a man who was shot by Americans. His son tells the incredible story and shows us a clip of the father telling it in his own words. Rather than hold animosity towards those who shot him, he is instead most appreciative and understanding. Director Taylor then follows Florent Plana, who has dedicated his time and energy to meeting with and documenting the stories of WWII veterans. This was yet another segment that was almost too affecting for me to keep my vision clear (if you get my drift).We watch a memorial service for veteran Jim Reid, who requested his ashes be spread on the sands of Utah Beach. His friends and family, as well as some locals join in for the tribute. Toward the end, we are informed how crucial it is to keep the French kids involved and informed, so that the era doesn't pass with the last of the survivors. American soldiers are identified as \"superheroes\", and even those who have carried guilt all these years, find themselves liberated by the Normandy visit. The French people will have it no other way. The film only touches on the amazing story of General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr, who despite walking with a cane and being the oldest soldier to take part in the invasion (56), led troops onto Omaha Beach. Also included is a brief interview with Helen Patton, General George Patton's granddaughter. As a finale, we get yet another look at the flag dress of young Dany Patix Boucherie, and as the film comes full circle, our understanding feels more complete. Such a touching tribute to the good that remains in humanity, and it's a lesson that has remained intact for three-quarters of a century.Boston Film Festival 2020.",

It evokes some of the deepest questions of our existence and leaves you contemplating them in a very blissful way. It has a hauntingly beautiful imagery and a great cast of people from various disciplines from science to philosophy and religion. Although it's a field that is still rather new to western culture, I think we all should take a deeper look into it. Also it's very refreshing that it includes studies about the link between psychedelics and consciousness in a very broad-minded way. Throughout the entire movie I had a smile on my face. I loved every aspect of it and highly recommend to see it for yourself.",

Yeah, there are 1-2 actors whose job is to recreate the scenes that were not filmed originally at the time. On the other hand, this film does good job in showing the faces of both underworld and police. Actually, the real people involved in real life incidents are brought to the camera and asked for interview to share their point of view, which is a good job because both police officers and ex-gangsters are invited on the camera. You will get to see the perspective of both police and goons in this movie, as well as some journalists. I will rate this movie 7 stars. The movie does not have a conclusion. It started from one point and ended on the other point, but I never got the point that they are trying to show us. What is it? I never got it. What is their sole purpose of making this documentary? I don't understand that bcause we start from 90's and directly jump into 2022. We never got the conclusion of what happened next after the incidents in 90's. They just showed that this police officer did that much encounter and xyz happened. So what? Everybody knows that. I am just rating this movie based on the real footages that they have collected. Besides, they showed everything that the public already knows. The movie does not reveals any hard secrets. Yeah, you might not know them if you don't read newspapers and encyclopedias but those who read, they already know the things shown in this movie. So, I will rate it 5 out 10.",

The reviews are probably objectively correct however I have interpreted the film completely differently.The film presents a multitude of perspectives from different local groups on the issue. The different local perspectives I feel add more to the film than if they just interviewed national groups who don't have any mirco perspective.I agree will another review that the real message is more about questioning how humans are intervening with nature and different ecosystems playing God. What is the impact of that and the difficulty in us actually getting it right. I think they wanted you to actually think and come up with your own opinion on the issue.Really well produced and executed that doesn't get repetitive. I have seen many lame shark documentaries that are very one sided but this is not one of them.Hopefully this makes sense as I have covid as I am writing this.",

And at the end they poured their poison and gave the country to Khomeini who was not interested in politics and had no education at all. He came and became the leader of the country and killed 50,000 prisoners and politicians of Iran. One of them was Amir Abbas Hoyda when they had Hoyda. They said to him, \"What did you do during your ministry so that we didn't kill you?\" He just took out a pen from his pocket and said that during the 12 years and 6 months of my ministry, this pen cost 2 Tomans and until now, this pen is 2 Tomans. They laughed at that, but now they understand the meaning of what he said, that inflation in Iran has reached 60%, but in any case, the people of 1979 did the stupidest revolution and I hope Mohammad Reza Shah's soul rests in peace.",

            "storyline": "The WikiLeaks lawyers Margaret Ratner Kunstler, Deborah Hrbek, Renata Avila and Melinda Taylor published an 'opinion piece' in Newsweek on May 17, 2017; WikiLeaks announced on the same day on Twitter that they may sue Laura Poitras: \"We are lawyers for WikiLeaks. We are speaking out because we believe that Laura Poitras's film Risk (2016), released in U.S. theaters on May 5 this year, places our clients in legal jeopardy. (...) Our first issue with \"Risk\" is that the film was edited in New York, where the raw footage can more easily be seized by the U.S. government. By moving the editing location from Berlin to the U.S., Poitras has endangered our clients and reneged on written agreements with WikiLeaks that explicitly forbid her from editing the footage in the United States. (...) Poitras has also violated her unambiguous promise to the subjects of the film that they would have an opportunity to review the film in advance and request changes, and that they could decline to appear if they or their lawyers felt that the movie put them at risk. Had the filmmaker not agreed to these express conditions, WikiLeaks' staff would not have allowed themselves to be filmed in the first place. Despite repeated requests, neither the subjects of the film nor their attorneys were granted a prior viewing of the film that Poitras intended to release in the U.S.. When, along with the general public, we were finally able to view \"Risk\", we were dismayed to discover that the film released in theaters is a different version, not only from that which premiered at Cannes the year before, but also from the version screened for Julian Assange and his UK counsel at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The film viewed in the Embassy just one month prior to its U.S. release was shorn of all narration and omitted numerous new scenes, significantly changing its tenor. That the 'real' film contained these elements was concealed, preventing Assange from exercising his contractual rights. Prior to its initial U.S. release, seven of the participants submitted non-consent forms to the producers advising Poitras and her team that they did not want to appear in the film. Regardless, Poitras went ahead and released it. (...) To convince the audience of her point about the prevalence of sexism, Poitras has marginalized and demeaned a number of women who work for WikiLeaks, choosing instead to give men most of the airtime and leaving scenes depicting the significant contributions of the women WikiLeaks journalists on the cutting room floor. In their place, we now see an intense focus on women taking instructions and throwing off adoring looks. Sarah Harrison, for example, a brilliant journalist and winner of the Willy Brandt prize for \"exceptional political courage,\" who at considerable personal risk helped Edward Snowden obtain political asylum, and who was accurately portrayed as having a central role in WikiLeaks work in the Cannes version, is now depicted as little more than a minion. Exactly what caused this pivot is not entirely clear. (...) The reason for the shift seems to be contained in the newly added voiceover, in which Poitras divulges that she was involved in an intimate relationship with one of the film's primary subjects, award-winning journalist Jacob Appelbaum. Appelbaum appears prominently in Poitras' Citizenfour (2014) as well as in \"Risk\". Although he does not work for WikiLeaks, Poitras conflates WikiLeaks with the organization he did work for, Tor, and makes him a central focus of the current version of \"Risk\". The Cannes premiere of \"Risk\" portrayed Appelbaum in a flattering light and Poitras did not disclose the nature of their relationship at that time. (...) Poitras was criticized after Cannes for appearing to be overly sympathetic to WikiLeaks. Instead of providing us with a more objective portrayal of her subject matter, she has re-framed her story to turn \"Risk\" into a film by Laura Poitras about Laura Poitras; a rather late coming-of-age story about the filmmaker discovering that there is sexism in her social and professional circles. Instead of a documentary about the abuse of state power and WikiLeaks' important role in exposing it, the emphasis of the film is now to highlight hotly disputed claims about an ex-boyfriend. We have to ask: Why choose this moment in history, when First Amendment and other fundamental rights are under attack, to undermine the credibility of an organization dedicated to government transparency and freedom of the press? (...) \"Risk\" might win attention for Poitras by pandering to tabloid narratives about its subjects, but it has done a great disservice to her fellow documentarians, and has profoundly betrayed her friends, her colleagues and her journalistic integrity.\"",

Modern technology plays a big role in their feud. The fights, that pit the toughest men in each of the families against one another, are filmed for immediate viewing by all competing families.Although the battles, billed as \"fair fights\" with impartial referees from non-combatant families, show the fighters giving their all, win or lose, it is the insulting and disparaging commentary, captured on film after the fights by the victors' clan members that fuel the feud for years to come. There are isolated shots of women and children. One woman, in particular, spoke at length about the need for all of this to come to an end. The greatest sadness in the film is the legacy that the feuding and fighting brings to the children who are doomed to follow in their dads and uncles footsteps, if not as fighters certainly as haters. One might conclude that these feuding families found a safer way of dealing with their hostility toward one another than shooting or stabbing.Filmed over a decade-long period from the mid-1990's to mid-2000's, viewers are offered only a glimmer of hope that things could change. But even this is marred by the reality that all it takes is a slight, an insult or a \"dis\" that could change things in a moment. As for the fighting itself, film-goers will see quite a few bloody battles, one with two out-of-shape grandfathers. But there is nothing to compare with professional boxing or mixed martial arts. These were pure street fights with some grabbing, gouging and biting (although all of that was cause for disqualification). As someone one who knows just enough about boxing I kept wondering, throughout all of the fights, why none of the combatants went for the body.",

We know Severin Films is capable that way and capacity. They speak to survivors (people who are still alive, family members and friends as well as co workers and fans) ... and there is a bit of a mystery regarding the later stages of her life ... I would not go as far as calling this ... well the focus is more on her life than how and why she died.The movies she did before Suzzanna, especially the ones that can be called Horror (though they do look like a lot of fun, if you can laugh at some nasty and blood filled effects - that have dated quite badly ... or in a funny way) ... I want to watch them! I kind of hope Severin puts some of them out ... they look like a \"hoot\" as they say.Suzzanna and the man she married ... well let's say some may feel there is a bit of a cringe element to it. Especially considering the emphasis on the characters they played (the relationship between them) ... very first time on screen and very last time ... you'll understand, I hope you are prepared enough for this.I am curious to see what kind of set Severin will release and while I think the Bruce Lee documentary will top this ... this is a fun watch too ... even if as most you have no clue who that was ...",

You could take the train from Wiesbaden to Frankfurt, buy a schnitzel visit a brothel for $20.00. The title caught my attention. The documentary come to the age old question: can women sell their body for sex? The documentary tries to give a balanced perspective, lean towards non-legalizing prostitution. In the end: Women want to control men access to sex. Germany history with prostitution is fascinating. The effect of an over saturated market. The amount of money generated from women on their back. The realization of the key prostitute body count with only 4 years in the business: disturbing. The biggest takeaway for me: Women are not to be trusted as to use of their body.",

It does seem to run longer than needed, but that may be due to the 'but'...The only, and honestly rather glaring, negative point is the actor providing voice-over readings of Young's letters. It is such a wildly over-the-top, cartoonish, comic book villain type performance that it's just in such stark contrast to the very serious interviews & expert analyses so as to take you out of it.I found myself more put off by this than the subject matter, and I'm certain I sprained my eyes rolling them so hard.

It shed some light on how she & other 'It' girls of that era made their mark in society and the media and all that goes on to get into and stay in the spotlight; From going to Diet Doctors in order to fit into designer sample sizes, getting a publicist, interviewing people who wrote about these girls or helped craft their image and brand etc. So far so good, and then the movie took a hard left and went into the life of a then anonymous blogger who wrote about these socialites. I initially thought it was a little side story that would help segue and tie everything together but it really didn't. The rest of the film is about the blogger, literally. There were parts that connected the bloggers world to that of the socialites he wrote about but the majority of it felt irrelevant to the film and unnecessary. Honestly I was very confused about what I watching, I had to double check that it was still the same documentary and that I hadn't accidentally changed it. Towards the end it dips back in to Tinsley very briefly and gives a vague description of her \"downfall\" which really wasn't a big deal as much as it was a change in the times. I wish the filmmakers would have dug deeper into her life and her fall from grace and how perspectives have shifted from then to now. They didn't, it was very surface level shallow. Again most of the focus being on the blogger from who he was then to today. Overall, the trailer & description was straight up false advertising, it's 2 films and 1 but only one of them is what's being advertised. The documentary was very disappointing and underwhelming, a choppy & confusing mess that had me scratching my head wondering why Tinsley Mortimer even agreed to be in this and asking myself wtf did I just watch?",

This three-part documentary series meticulously crafts every element, from its raw footage to its poignant writing and beautifully animated sequences. Each piece is presented with such authenticity and care, it draws the viewer into one of the most controversial periods of post-Independence Indian history.Swanand Kirkire's stellar voice-over narration adds a profound layer of depth to the documentary. His voice guides us through the turbulent years from 1975 to 1977 when Indira Gandhi declared a nationwide state of emergency. The series excels in providing a balanced perspective, making it accessible and informative for viewers who are both familiar and unfamiliar with this period.The use of archival footage from India's Films Division, the BBC, British Pathe, AP, and Getty, alongside animated sequences, enriches the storytelling. It captures the essence of the era, depicting how civil liberties and press freedom were curtailed, and elections were canceled. Vikramaditya Motwane, known for his previous hit \"Jubilee,\" offers a profound deep dive into this slice of contemporary history.Motwane's approach to storytelling is noteworthy, blending new insights and detailed information for those knowledgeable about the events, while offering a fresh and engaging narrative for new audiences. The series presents a \"weird and interesting and stark period of modern history\" with a masterful touch, making it both educational and compelling.Unfortunately, despite its brilliance, \"Indi(r) a's Emergency\" has not seen the light of any cinema house or OTT platform due to regulatory issues. This makes my experience of watching it at the festival all the more precious, as I eagerly await the day it becomes accessible to a wider audience. This documentary is a significant piece of work that deserves to be seen, shedding light on a pivotal moment in India's history with unparalleled skill and sensitivity.",

Peter Wohlleben would like a word, or several thousand. \"The Hidden Life of Trees\" follows the maverick tree hugger around as he tries to make the case for a complex, communicating community of wood. Based on his best selling book of the same name, the documentary brings the lanky German to life as a media savvy eco-warrior with some astounding propositions. Dispelling some startling myths like our misguided attempt to reseed the forest instead of letting nature do all the work, is chief to the power of this film.The composting, self-fertilizing nature of rotting trees, and the connection with the entire ecosystem is an eye-opener. Wohlleben gets a little carried away though, whimsically portraying trees as sentient beings capable of high level communication. Yes there is some kind of interplay here in nature's wonderland, which humans are probably best to leave the damn alone, but social advances by trees like making agreements with fungi, would be better served with less magical wonder and more actual science.The movie works best when presenting clinical facts with beautiful cinematography, aiming at the just the right balance of eco awareness, eco dread, and possible eco solutions. Trees do appear to be more complex than anyone ever imagined and their existence is chief to our own, so a better understanding of what the heck is going on in the woods is probably a pretty good idea. Wohlleben comes across as a lone wolf advocate, which sadly, is the case for many an important cause. This doc just might change all that.hipCRANK.",

Many of the scientists that are interviewed, are from the highly cited Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and actually publish research in these fields. Their explanations are accompanied with beautiful and informative visuals.I have a minor critique: Some parts could be a bit more specific, especially more information on tippings points, regional vs global impact and how far we are from reaching them. Then again, the documentation is already ~52 minutes and I understand that it is near impossible to find the right balance of depth.In my opinion, this is one of the best documentaries on climate change and tipping points out there.",

Their initial guide, Rich, had to stop them on their first attempt, and even on the second they are largely not educated on how to hike the canyon's unique dangers (heat, water, weather, etc) well, take dangerous/not necessarily interesting routes, and make numerous questionable decisions that could easily have gotten them killed.I think we could have gotten a much better feel for the canyon's many wonders without the slog of hiking from one end to the other, but to do focused treks at key geographic, historical, and visual locations.",

Guijarro's $2 purchase might be worth up to five million dollars but before he can cash in he must try and gather some evidence to show that it's legit and that of Billy the Kid.This film works as two films rolled into one. For starters, it works as a pretty good documentary on the final years of Billy the Kid as Guijarro searches various locations to try and determine where the photo was taken. We learn a lot of Billy the Kid during the 1878 period and we also get some nice re-enactments. The documentary also works as seeing someone blow through their life savings gambling on something they bought is actually a major historical image that is worth millions. Not only does the story of Billy the Kid work but so does the story of the photo finder who travels through four states trying to get proof even after several people tell him the photo isn't real.BILLY THE KID: NEW EVIDENCE is certainly an entertaining film that manages to keep you in suspense as the mystery unravels.",

But the sentiment of many in Bad Axe is pretty much the same as our town.As a member of the Cambodian-Mexican family that director & cinematographer David Siev is documenting, he lovingly shot this intimate story of the travails of his family during the COVID years in an area that suspected Asian families, especially those that were public about their sympathies. Family members were shown including their flaws and moments of anger and despair. I think this was a very honest film.And how wonderful it was to see the entire family at the TCFF showing. It is impressive that their restaurant /bar (which so struggled during the quarantine) is doing better than ever and is embraced by most in their community. David has returned the love. (And you gotta love how feisty David's sister, Jaclyn, is throughout the difficult times for all of them.)",

Danland follows Dan \"Porno Dan\" Leal, a successful pornographer, as he searches for real love in his own life, forever complicated by the trappings and temptations of his chosen career. The film follows Dan for several years as he falls in and out of love with various women, all while carrying on a busy schedule as a maker (and star) of porn films. While this movie is not pornography, some scenes are rather graphic, so the timid may want to steer clear. But if you appreciate a raw, honest story, it doesn't get much better than this. Danland succeeds in humanizing a subject that many would write off as simply a frat boy out of control. Berger manages to get under Dan's skin numerous times, bringing out a side that is vulnerable, lonely, and tragically sad. Yet, there are laughs as well, such as when Dan manages to turn the tables and get under the filmmaker's skin. Berger's awkward expression when she is spontaneously recruited by Dan to shoot an unfolding porn scene is well worth the price of admission. In the end, Danland is a human tale, demonstrating the fact that deep down, whether we're porn stars or accountants, we all just want to be loved.",

This 50 minute documentary of this world wide super group, one of the very best in the world, is just a great watch, despite the sound quality at times with the interviews, which is expected, being over 40 years old. ABBA, formed in 1972, followed two years later, with their first major hit with WATERLOO (Released> Tuesday, 12th March, 1974), the winner of the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, which led to their first of nine number one's in the UK. The following eight number one's were > MAMA MIA (Released> September 1975), FERNANDO (Released> March 1976), and was ABBA's biggest world hit, covering 13 countries and selling over £10 million. Then it was DANCING QUEEN (Released> Monday, 16th August, 1976 - on my 20th birthday, which a year later 1977, on my 21st birthday, was the death of ELVIS PRESLEY, Tuesday, 16th August, 1977 - he was only 42 years of age), sorry for drifting away from ABBA. Their following number one's of the nine were KNOWING ME, KNOWING YOU (Released> Monday, 11th October, 1976), THE NAME OF THE GAME (Released in 1977), TAKE A CHANCE ON ME (Released> Monday, 12th December, 1977), THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL (Released> Saturday, 21st July, 1980}, Finally the last of ABBA's nine number one's was SUPER TROOPER (Released> Monday, 3rd November, 1980). Unfortunately MONEY, MONEY, MONEY (Released> Monday, 11th October, 1976) which was another great song, finished 3rd in the UK charts, and could have been ABBA's 10th out 10 of number one's. DANCING QUEEN was their only number one in the USA. MAMA MIA itself, made more money than everything else ABBA released. And that is why they are one of the very best in the world. (ps)",

            "storyline": "I wasn't familiar with Dory Previn. Even the 2006 song \"Dory Previn\" by one of my favorite groups, Camera Obscura, didn't inspire me to look up Dory Previn, and the name slipped out of my head. I must've seen her name multiple times, yet it never stuck.Until February, that is, when I witnessed singer/songwriter Julia Greenberg perform a couple of songs by Ms. Previn. Though dating from the early 1970s, I was struck by the modern sensibility (let's call it the Liz Phair era) of the lyrics. Plus, the songs were good! Right up my alley. I wanted to know more.As luck would have it, Julia Greenberg has co-directed a documentary about Dory Previn, and it is excellent. Of course, it doesn't hurt for a documentary to have a fascinating subject, and oh boy does Previn fit the bill. Girl from Woodbridge, New Jersey with a rough, domineering dad suddenly finds herself paired with André Previn (him I'd heard of!) writing songs for big-time Hollywood movies (two I've seen: Tall Story, 1960, and Inside Daisy Clover, 1965); he wrote the music, she wrote the words. It's Hollywood, so they fall in love and get married.All's mostly fine until André leaves Dory for Mia Farrow (post-Sinatra, pre-Woody). Having previously weathered a mental breakdown, this turn of events sends Dory into a tailspin, and the documentary kicks into another compelling gear.I won't reveal more of Dory's story, but suffice to say, rather than being crippled by mental illness, Dory Previn reinvents herself and thrives. (Good timing, too, as the '60s gave way to the loosey-goosey 1970s.) And this is what sets On My Way to Where apart from mad-genius music documentaries such as The Devil and Daniel Johnston, You're Gonna Miss Me (Roky Erickson), and Have You Got It Yet? (Syd Barrett). Dory Previn has a very different relationship with what's going on in her mind.To capture all this in a coherent and entertaining fashion, Julia Greenberg teamed with experienced filmmaker Dianna Dilworth (writer/director of the well-received mellotron documentary Mellodrama). The directors had full access to Ms. Previn's archives, including thousands of pages of journals. One thing I was riveted by in the journal pages shown: Dory's wordplay could teeter out of control, turning a word every which way, breaking words down and building them up, almost trapping her in a loop. I was immediately reminded of Woody Guthrie's writings as Huntington's chorea ate away at his brain - wild creativity devolving into gibberish. Yet once again, Dory is different, keeping the wolves of mental illness at bay.To visually bring Ms. Previn's journals to life, Greenberg and Dilworth deploy their secret weapon: esteemed veteran animator Emily Hubley. Previn's simple character drawings are a perfect launching pad for Hubley to take flight, filling the screen with whimsy and awe, thoughts colliding, flitting this way and that. So much of Hubley's work has been inspired by and paired with music, so this film is an ideal project for her. Her animated segments raise it to yet another level.Currently on the festival circuit, I cannot recommend this documentary highly enough. Keep your eyes open for it. If you are a fan of glamorous old Hollywood, of '70s singer/songwriters, of strong, independent, inspirational women who are survivors - not to mention a unique take on mental health - Dory Previn: On My Way to Where will absolutely captivate you. Personally, I know I'll never again forget the name Dory Previn.",

Co-director and long-time Vonnegut friend Robert B Weide even admits the renowned author told him, \"anything that is any good of mine is on a printed page\". The strange thing here is that by the time it's over, we aren't sure if we've watched a documentary on the life of Kurt Vonnegut or one about Weide's friendship with and respect of the man.Vonnegut, of course, is one of the great American writers of the 20th Century. Born and raised in Indianapolis, he wrote novels, short stories, and plays, and his work was noted for his clever humor and detail. His big breakthrough came in 1969 when \"Slaughterhouse Five\" became a best-seller, and his other works include \"Cat's Cradle\" (1963) and \"Breakfast of Champions\" (1973). As we see during the film, his live talks became 'must-attend' events due to his brilliance and ability to speak directly (and with caustic wit) about a world that he didn't always maintain the greatest hope for.Weide and co-director Don Argott address Vonnegut's shortcomings as a family man, by allowing his daughters to tell Daddy stories in their own words. What's clear is that Vonnegut being captured by Germans during WWII at the Battle of the Bulge, and subsequently held at Dresden was a driving force not just in his writing, but in his approach to life. He survived the Allied bombing by taking cover in ... you guessed it ... a freezer in a slaughterhouse.Archival footage of Vonnegut and interviews with his daughters and biographers, give us a pretty complete looks at his life. Oddly, it's Mr. Weide who seems to spend as much time on camera as anyone, leading us to wonder about his focus in what he terms a '40 year' project. Possibly the most interesting segment involves the various drafts of Vonnegut's most popular work (\"Slaughterhouse Five\" was his 6th novel), and the specific comparisons of the author to lead character Billy Pilgrim. Vonnegut passed away in 2007, and we have little doubt his response to that would be ... \"So it goes.\"",

Then, after several years of inclusion with her new parents and siblings, she was abruptly separated from them without further contact and returned to her original family.Grief, loss and separation permeate the lives of all involved, leaving it to the adult Brenda to reconcile the damaged lives of both families and herself. Brenda's first memories were of growing up in a loving white family. Decades later she feels disconnected from both halves of her life. Naturally, this is a story saturated with emotions and hurt. Hearts all round have been broken and two families torn apart.Brenda's efforts to repair the harm to all her loved ones unearth records that show the failings and lies of the welfare department through her sorry young life.The Last Daughter is a documentary about Brenda's journey to find the truth of a part of our history that has been swept under the carpet. So much has been irretrievably lost by so many, all victims of the Australian government's genocidal policies to eradicate the First Nations. The further worry is that while this story starts in the 1970s, it is not even consigned to the past, with the taking of aboriginal children continuing today.",

            "storyline": "Dana Ben-Ari's Breastmilk plays like the most recent effort in the mumblecore subgenre of film, focusing on long, intimate conversations with a diverse group of people, predominately women, but often times their significant others, and frequent uses of an amateur approach to show the film's low budget. This aesthetic won't be too burdensome for most people, but the effect leaves me personally wishing I had watched a film about the issues of breastfeeding children done with a realistic, fictional narrative by the likes of somebody like Joe Swanberg or the brothers Duplass.The problem with a documentary about breastfeeding is the topic is too thin to adequately sustain a ninety-one minute film, especially when you almost completely ignore the big social issue at hand here, which is should breastfeeding be allowed in public? Week after week, I see the Breastmilk Facebook page light up with links to articles concerning women who have been kicked out of public places because they were publicly breastfeeding; did director Dana Ben-Ari forget to include a segment on that and thought linking numerous different articles on Facebook would make up for it? It's bizarre to see a film about breastfeeding spend five minutes talking about the pornographic fetish of lactation and include multiple montages of breastmilk being squirted out of a woman's nipple, but completely ignore the core issue that has been plaguing this method of nursing a baby for decades now and seriously needs some sort of a voice.Breastmilk follows numerous different couples, specifically the female in the relationship, and their issues, views, and methods on breastfeeding and the often challenging but rewarding process that it is. It weaves in and out between couples, and even gets some lactation doctors and consultants to chime in on their views. Often times, the film plays like a talky, contemplative film of the mumblecore subgenre discussing not only breastfeeding but gender roles and the woman's essential role in bringing up a child. A health worker named Patrece Griffith-Murray even brings up a fantastic point in the early part of the film, stating, \"every woman has a reason why they breastfeed,\" and Ben-Ari succeeds by not making the film statistical and overly-analytical, but personal and using specific case examples.The two most dominant women in my life - my mother and my seventy-five-year-old grandmother, whom I call every day - both bottle-fed their children. At the time I was born, my mother was working grueling, twelve-hour days in the trauma unit of Loyola Hospital, with little time to get a break or have lunch, let alone pump her breasts and assure the milk got to me via my father. Not to mention, my mother was diagnosed with toxemia, and also is known to be a very anxious soul, which disrupts the process of breastfeeding. The same reason, combined with added personal stress, was the same reason my grandmother didn't breastfeed her three children either. Breastmilk thankfully recognizes the issue that breastfeeding is a very challenging and trying thing, which not every woman can handle or can do as easy as others. As trivial of a comment as this may seem, it does a great job of not belittling those who raised their children on something like Oberweis milk (speaking now).But at the end of it all, the biggest problem with Breastmilk is it becomes too long-winded for its own good; this is an HBO short documentary with a maximum running length of fifty minutes that was stretched out to a tiresome and dreary ninety-one minutes. On top of that, the film neglects the biggest point about its topic and has its structural process become grating because of the lack of new or enlightening information on its subject. Still, however, the things Breastmilk does correctly, from its personal approach to its lack of statistical bombardment and its respect for women who go the bottle-feeding route, make it the marginally enjoyable film that it is.Directed by: Dana Ben-Ari.",

That's us, beings toward death. At the same time, we have desire, why we are organisms in space and time, so it's desire in the face of death.

They are judgmental and jump to conclusions. Now, obviously, they already know the outcome, but they should comment on the case as if they wanted to understand it and find out the truth, rather then as if they are writing a fictional story.The psychotherapy expert labels Chris a narcissist, yet throughout the documentary there is no indication that he was one. In fact, he was described as the complete opposite. He wasn't flashy, he didn't like to be in centre of attention, he wasn't manipulative, he was calm and collected, he avoided confrontation and he didn't like that Shannan filmed him and posted him on social media all the time. Yet, here we have this expert just throw that label on him.The FBI expert provided comments that at times sounded like I was listening to an angry mob posting comments on social media. There was no expertise in any of it.It all sounded like the commentary was done to add drama and to rile the viewer up, because we know that planting negative feelings in someone is a good way to keep them hooked. That's what social media has been doing to get people addicted and that's what advertisers on social media do to get you to comment on their posts.The documentary did not seem credible to me.Another thing I thought was off was that the jump cuts were too quick and at times the pace seemed to be much too fast.

It focused on Albert Einstein, maybe the greatest scientific mind that ever lived, and on the crucial years between the writing of his basic works describing the theory of relativity and nature of light in 1905, until the experimental proof that confirmed the theory of generalized relativity and the nature of gravity in 1922 followed by the receiving of the Nobel prize (but not for the theory of gravity but rather for the description of photons and structure of light.These were years in which Einstein turned upside down all the science in place for more than two centuries based on the classical physics founded by Newton. These were years where the whole world turned upside down, empires in place in Europe for many years tumbled down under revolutions and new orders emerged predicting peace and welfare but bringing the seeds of more and atrocious human suffering. In the middle of all these storms Einstein succeeded to not only to create some of the most magnificent pieces of work that human mind ever conceived, but also kept a straight moral position, opposing war and nationalist fantasies.The documentary at History Channel was smartly made. It brought on screen a battery of biographers, scientists and historians (Walter Isaacson, his most famous biographer among them) who talked about Einstein and his times, and succeeded to link their commentaries into a logical thread that built a story line that fascinated and kept me watching like at the best thriller dramas. All was explained clearly - the historic background, the biographic details, the science and the family life (yes, Einstein was no saint or family values model) and the reconstitution of the experiments that eventually proved his theories looked like a good and real Indiana Jones film. The 'Einstein' documentary set for me a model of what biography movies should look like.",

It is a must-see for anyone searching for the meaning of faith and love for all mankind.In these days of hype about war and bravery (or otherwise) it is refreshing to see a story of true heroism; a story that reflects true sacrifice and faith exercised over and over again.You must see it for yourself and get others to see it! Encourage your bookstores, libraries, and video rental facilities to get copies of this video. Failing that, buy one yourself!!! Many kudos to Terry Benedict for recognizing this great story and bringing it to the screen!",

            "storyline": "\"Unspoken\" is a PBS documentary that will likely leave you feeling depressed. After all, it's about the boarding schools which were set up by the US government...boarding schools intended at obliterating the culture of the various American Indian nations. In its place, the government wanted to create 'Americans'...loyal and with little if any allegiance to their tribe. To do this, speaking or writing in their native tongues was strictly forbidden, hair was cut and their clothing was 'white'...sort of like military uniforms and nothing like their tribal garb.What is saddest about this film is listening to the many sad stories and remembrances from the interviewees. However, it wasn't ALL sad...many also held memories of friendships they developed through these schools. So, I guess it isn't ALL sad....just about 98%.Like a good documentary, it educates and angers as well as annoys...and I mean this in the best possible way.",

But of course it's the cleaning company founder, trans woman Sandra, who is the star. She's suffered a lot of blows in her life and my guess is she's a lot tougher than we see her here.

            "storyline": "Every American should see this film, even though I think the 'values' it expresses are downright evil. People should see it just to be warned about this disease of violence and murder that is metastasizing on our southern border. As documentary cinema it's pretty good; it follows certain characters who have an intimate involvement of the drug culture and drug trade. There is no narration, just interviews with essentially two main players: one a Mexican CSI investigator, and the other a morally ambiguous songwriter who specializes in 'narcocorridos', songs about the Mexican drug trade and the carnage that goes with it. Narcocorridos exploit sensational stories of murder and violence, naming real events, real drug lords and real victims, and generally casting them in a heroic aura which is far better than these criminal scumbags deserve. Corridos, songs which tell stories, are a venerable tradition in Mexican folk music. Traditionally they have a sweet, lyrical quality, telling tales of Pancho Villa or the revenge of jilted lovers and the exploits of famous bandits. Of late the corrido has taken a darker turn, celebrating the nihilistic deeds and deaths of narcotraficantes and in general glorifying and promoting the culture of trafficking and murder. For this reason narcocorridos have been banned in Mexico as an incitement to violence. And, unavoidably, since the songs often name players, dates and locations the bands themselves become partisans in the drug wars and have become too often the victims of the mayhem they celebrate. The songwriter interviewed in this documentary lives in California and makes his money off the public's fascination with the horrors of the drug trade. His band features, along with the traditional instruments like tuba and accordion, a bazooka, which is shown but not, we must hope, played on stage. Gone are the bittersweet sounds of Los Alegres de Teran or even Los Cadetes de Linares and instead we have musicians with attitude. They seem to be really good musicians but their music is drowned out by the attitude. On the other hand, we also follow a young policeman whose job is to collect forensic evidence from crime scenes after the shootouts between rival gangs. This often involves severed body parts strewn conspicuously about the neighborhood as a message to the other guys. It's an awful, thankless, job because few of the murders are solved and the corruption of the Mexican authorities is epic. He is careful, dedicated and in danger. Policemen in the northern states are killed on a regular basis. This fellow represents the best of Mexican manhood, unlike the locos you see posing with their pistols and their AKs. You get to see what he's up against. He is the real hero, but is anybody going to write a corrido about him? The problem with the drug culture is that is isn't actually a culture, with its traditional values. It is instead the absence of values, the absence of culture, a black hole that threatens to swallow light itself. Santa Muerte is not a real saint. She is the anti-saint. Near the end we see an entire cemetery where the rich drug dealers go when they die (seldom of natural causes). Each mausoleum is like a big ornate church with domes and cupolas and there looks to be a whole city of them. And the windows are glazed with bulletproof glass. The drug culture becomes a parody of itself.",

The title Riverboom is already quite mysterious (although there is finally an explanation), and one also wonders how they can release a documentary in 2024 that was filmed in 2002, especially in Afghanistan, where everything has once again changed since then.It turned out to be totally surprising and delightful. The fact that the video cassettes were lost for 20 years certainly made this a totally different movie than it would have been if it had been made quickly. The filmmaker was able to look upon the events with quirky detachment instead of finding everything dramatic and scary, which would have been the main impression immediately after the events. These guys almost got into serious trouble many times during their circle trip of the country.The inclusion of still photography, especially Afghan portraits, along with the video increased the impact as one tries to image what has become of these local people in the last 20 years. Some of them probably live in my neighbourhood, which is now called Little Kabul in Paris.",

Only a few cases are used to support the benefits of such a diet, which seems to help those with certain medical issues, and not necessarily meant for mainstream consumption.

It would be hard to overstate the impact it had on me. And yet, when I went to look for the record at the stores where I lived, it was like searching for the Holy Grail. I had no luck finding it or anything else by this mysterious artist.Eventually many years later I was overjoyed to find a compilation record by him called \"Savoir Faire\" that included not only the song that I had been obsessed with for so long but many other incredibly great tunes.The documentary Heaven Stood Still delves into the mystique that has surrounded Mink Deville frontman Willy Deville for all these years. His first three albums were released by Capitol, but due to disappointing sales he was summarily dropped. Later he recorded in Europe and lived for a time in New Orleans. I was very impressed by the archival footage of the band's amazing early years, but found the warts and all excavation of Willy's long slow decline to be emotionally crushing. I suspected that drug use had contributed to the deterioration he suffered in his later years but I had no idea how pervasive it became.There's some enlightening interviews with the likes of Ben E. King (Stand By Me) and Peter Wolf, the singer from J. Geils Band. There is also a live performance of \"Mixed Up Shook Up Girl\" which I'd never seen before that literally gave me chills!",

It should resinat with a mass audience. Nonetheless, the humanitarian eye of Kyler, implores audiences to adopt a posture of compassion and understanding, because the struggle an addict faces is a deepening one.

The phenomenon is jarring and repeated all around the United States, even world. Normally things of this grotesque nature and frequency demand answers. The fact the mystery of remains should be cause for alarm. Instead, it seems to have faded into the folklore and paranormal realm, with either denial by some or a nudge and a wink by others. That, thankfully, is not the way it's presented by host and producer Linda Moulton Howe as she covers it with serious and excellent intent.This is very real and horrific. It's a great burden by cattle ranchers stressing them emotionally and financially. They deserve better answers as does the public. Even PETA is surprisingly silent on the whole phenomenon, one that is obviously cruel and unusual treatment of a living creature resulting in death. If this is related to UFOS, or some secret government program, there may be hope the recent whistleblower revelation will ultimately create leverage to help explain this as a side to whatever else comes to light. It needs to be addressed as the disclosure process moves forward - it does seem to be related in some unthinkable way.All I can say is folks need to see this now vintage look at one of the strangest phenomenon ever to regularly happen on our planet because it hasn't gone away. It deserves not to be swept under the rug. I'd go further and say it's now time for a new equally serous documentary to catch this bizarre type of animal mutilation up to date.",

The \"voyeuristic\" angles that are often employed in the film actually obscure important images - at one point a character's face is blocked by random objects in the room as she talks. If you are going to rely on visual style to carry a film, at least make good, meaningful choices with the shots.I wished the film had spent more quality time with the characters. The film does not really present much reason for the audience to invest and care about the characters, other than just presenting the fact that they are struggling dancers and boxers in Cuba.

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. Obsession. Commitment. Dedication. Devotion. Pursuit of perfection. Whatever this is, it goes deeper than imitation. Akio Sakurai has spent thirty-plus years trying to become ... well, let's use his quote: \"I want to be Jimmy Page.\" Yes, Akio is not paying tribute to his guitar hero, and he zooms past the definition of fanboy. Director Peter Michael David chronicles Akio's dream (over 8 years), and the film left me with conflicting emotions. Should I be in awe of Akio's guitar-playing, or should I be worried about the mental state of someone so focused on being someone else?Akio tells us it happened when he was about 19 years old. He watched the 1976 documentary, THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME, a concert film showcasing Led Zeppelin's famed 1973 shows at Madison Square Garden. He along with many of us, were enthralled by the band, and especially by their ferocious guitarist, Jimmy Page. But it's only Akio, a resident of Japan, and the son of a Kimono designer, who decided to 'become' Jimmy Page.We are along for the ride as Akio meets with his costume designer, the technician who creates his pickups, the factory where his guitars are made, and the tuner of his amps. These are steps most guitarists take, but Akio's difference is that everything must exactly match what Jimmy Page used ... right down to the vintage amps and painstakingly matching stitching on the infamous Black Dragon suit.Akio played clubs in Japan for years ... matching note for note the way Jimmy Page a particular song in a particular year at a particular concert. It was 2012 when things changed. While on tour in Japan, Jimmy Page (yes, THE Jimmy Page) attended one of Akio's shows and gave him an enthusiastic reception, truly appreciating the attention to craft on display. This 'dream-like' moment inspired Akio's wife to encourage him to follow his dream to America, specifically California.From this point on, the film follows Akio as he joins a club fand, Led Zepagain. As you can imagine, Akio's obsession over every note played didn't always sit well with bandmembers who just wanted to be a tribute band. We see clips of the band performing, and we go behind the scenes for some uncomfortable debates. Akio continues to hone his Page-ness by obsessing over bootleg recordings of Zeppelin concerts through the years. When the band dissolves, Akio forms another band and books a gig at Hollywood's iconic Whisky A Go Go (opened in 1964), a standout performance that we see, yet one that cost Akio a great deal of money.We are treated to clips from many of Mr. Jimmy's performances, and his guitar skills are obvious. Bouncing back and forth from Japan to the United States allowed him to do what he loved, but we can't help but wonder at what cost. Akio's need to control details and unwillingness to compromise cost him his bandmates. We are told these traits are 'very Japanese', so it's excused as a cultural thing We do see Akio's joy at being selected to join Jason Bonham's (son of the late John Bonham), but we can't help wonder what drives one man to inhabit the style of another for so many years. As impressive as Akio is, it's also kind of sad.*Note: the film made the festival circuit in 2019, but only now being distributed.Abramorama will release the film in theaters beginning September 1st.",

            "storyline": "This is hands down the most comprehensive documentary that has been made about the bleak realities of those Americans who are experiencing homelessness. It was such an eye-opener to see what causes people to become unhoused and literally have \"no address.\" The documentary delves deep into the complex factors-such as mental illness, addiction, lack of affordable housing, and systemic failures-that contribute to homelessness, giving viewers a more nuanced understanding of the issue. It also showcases a number of non-profits and mission groups around the US who are making major headway in helping those experiencing homelessness, which was both inspiring and heartwarming to see. The incredible work being done by these organizations provides hope and a sense of humanity in the face of such a devastating crisis. The documentary's raw, unflinching portrayal of homelessness is balanced by the uplifting stories of resilience and compassion, leaving a powerful message of hope. It's an eye-opening, thought-provoking, and deeply moving film-a must-watch for anyone wanting to better understand this critical issue.",

While people have explained that while they did not explore every music genre they explored the genre's of the deep roots of America's music and it's music history. And music genre's that have been underrepresented in current popular music. And they did this holistically and genuinely.While the task seems impossible to create a new anthem that can represent this country today, I think this documentary takes a really deep look into the need for this change and recognizes the need to represent many cultures and traditions that have built this country musically.Incredible work really looking into the different prospectives of music from the cities chosen, and to bring the artists together to create lyrics was fascinating to watch as an artist. It makes me feel inspired to see their strong and wonderful attempt for change, and to do so for music is even more fulfilling. All while truly making you think about the importance of music and it's political, cultural, and spiritual impact on this country.Do yourself a favor and watch this, because the music history lesson you get alone is so worth the journey.",

When things did not go his way, the diagnosis he is not narcissistic and his credentials were questioned, he decided to sabotage the documentary by escalating. This behaviour was to intimidate the film-maker into ending the project. IT WORKED! I think this could have been predicted. This is one of the tactics of the psychopath. I think the film maker should have researched more and been prepared for this. We have one advantage over psychopaths, they are predictable. Once you become aware of the tactics, you always know they will always behave this way. This is one of their weaknesses, another is bragging on tape!It would have been interesting to see the violent reaction if the tape of Sam bragging about his purchased credentials at the time he defended them with the psychologist. You think Sam was abusive at the end of the film, it would have been fireworks, just to get the focus away from being caught out!My high score is due to the fact it exposed how totally stupid psychopaths are, it doesn't make them any less dangerous to the uninformed. It is rare to see this on film, their manipulation usually doesn't allow it. Most of us would have used common and not taken part because we know our lies would be uncovered. The psychopaths ego would over-ride common sense and risk does not phase them, they thrive on it. Great doco!",

It gives thoughtful discussion showing different views and goes on location to Canada, New Zealand and Sweden, countries which revamped prostitution laws in fairly recent years. A central character, the lawyer responsible for forcing Canada to legalize prostitution, looks like a nice enough guy. He argues that some people really do want to be sex workers (true!) and they should be allowed to do that despite what anyone thinks. But in the end, he seems like a self-satisfied blowhard and somewhat shallow, blustery showoff with no deeply thought out solutions for how to help protect vulnerable women from violence and exploitation.I wished he could have sat down directly with the prohibition movement people after they toured Sweden because at least one of his theories (that it's human nature and raw impulse and therefore unavoidable) seemed profoundly rebutted by Swedes defending the Swedish model of criminalizing the john but protecting and supporting the prostitute.If you watch this film, have the grit to finish it all the way through to the end. Don't just stop midway because the subject matter seems salacious, unpalatable or embarrassing. This is a good topic for dialogue and this film is a good way to jump-start the dialogue. Nothing dark and sinister is glossed over in this film. It does not trivialize or argue for prostitution. It tries to get at real truth. One is left thinking, a very good way to be left sometimes when issues are complex. I wish it had been longer and there'd been more interaction among the different people involved.",

Literally over glamorizing these jobs and exaggerating their exploits. There is even a documentary that shows how the Pentagon and military are in cohoots with Hollywood to push an agenda.

In fact, at the end of the day, I believe people do want to know when there's some major tragedy going on; when there's some unacceptable situation happening in this world.

This film is not in that category, but more of a trip down memory lane for the young boy, Collier, 20+ years after his mother was murdered.I stopped watching about 30 minutes into the documentary because it failed to indicate there were any curious aspects of the actual crime or legal trial. Rather the focus was on Collier both as a 12 year old when his mother was murdered (through video testimony at trial) and as an adult trying to reconnect with various adults involved in his and his mothers social sphere before and after the murder.The only aspect that I found remotely interesting was that 12 year old Collier was unusually very adult like as a 12 year old, possibly due to his somewhat unique relationship with his mother and what were clearly unusual circumstances growing up in that household. That said, it was not enough to hold my interest and I didn't get the sense there would be any surprising developments as the story progressed, so I felt no compulsion to go further.",

At some point, the folks who have been growing things are suddenly served with an eviction notice with little time to spare. Over the years, the barren space has grown rich with green, small plants have become trees, there is an oasis in the middle of concrete poverty--and the owner, after what appear to be shifty dealings behind doors, decides some storage bins would be more advantageous, and certainly more profitable.Fortunately, several local leaders contact some folks at Los Angeles City Hall--mainly without much results, but the attendant brouhaha draws in celebrity support from folks like Willy Nelson and Joan Baez, and fund-raising begins in order to reach the price first named by the landowner--who quickly becomes, for all time, a loathsome nemesis who lacks both foresight and imagination, an individual whose nasty sense of revenge becomes more pressing to him than financial gain. He's a heartless number-cruncher right out of Dickens, a Ralph Nickleby or a Scrooge--but without redemption. One cringes to think such people exist in an enlightened culture. He could consider numerous options--but only wants an eviction--now!I was appalled at much of what happens, and I suspect you will be as well. The filmmaker does not offer all the answers, nor does he tie up all the strings laid out early in the plot--but he profiles a cultural group admirable for their love of the land and for their tenacious desire to raise food for themselves and family in a once-sterile setting. This documentary is not entirely a downer, but several scenes made me cry out with grief and anger.",

It also illustrates the social environment, the condition, and general sense of the time when she grown up in the 50's. Generally speaking an informative and intriguing document. The only thing that bugs me is the ending and how the relationship between her and Ted Hughes was presented. I do know there are these conflicting views between the two sides of the Atlantic ocean, and there is this view that her suicide is the result of a more deeper, pervasive psychological issue, but simply stating that \"her marriage with Ted Hughes has ended\" without any detail is strikingly incomprehensible. I couldn't quite understand how an event which has such a fundamental psychological impact on one's life can be (probably) intentionally ignored in such a context. But maybe, just maybe, we don't have to mention that because we all know what happened?",

The name Steve \"Spaz\" Williams can be spoken in the same breath as pioneering computer animation. And this documentary returned to him some of the justice he'd lost over the years.Documentary Analysis & Deep Dive:This documentary is essentially a love letter to fans of CGI and dinosaurs, particularly the \"Jurassic Park\" movies. After all, it was Steve Williams who sat in the CGI chair creating digital dinos for significant portions of the 1993 movie, directed by Steven Spielberg.I especially liked how the documentary didn't merely extol Steve's computer-cool virtues but also his penchant for disobedience and disruption. That reckless punk-like attitude led to his downfall in the business at a time when he could have soared to great heights.But the \"punk\" in the title of this documentary actually stands for the revolutionary artistic decisions and actions that Steve took, which ended up redefining the way movies like \"Jurassic Park\" were even made. It certainly set wide standards for Sci-Fi and Fantasy movies to come.Steve used traditional art techniques that involved line drawings to create super-realistic digital art, like the time he focused those skills on rendering dinosaurs for the \"JP\" movie. He was the first to pull it off and become a sensation. And though the sensation was short-lived, his techniques weren't.His efforts were pivotal to the quality that Industrial Light & Magic (the reputed film company) and LucasFilm (another prestigious movie company) desired for their projects. He was sought after by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron, for crying out loud!Final Notes:Steve's work spanned cult-classic movies like \"Jurassic Park\" (1993), \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1991), \"The Abyss\" (1989), \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" (1977), \"Spawn\" (1997), \"Eraser\" (1996), \"The Mask\" (1994), and \"Jumanji\" (1995).I loved every movie, and only after watching this stellar documentary did I realize what exactly made me admire and adore the realism and attention to natural detailing in those productions. It was the work of a dedicated team of artists and filmmakers, one of whom was Steven Williams.There was a lot of pain in this documentary and plenty of regret too. They also captured Steve's struggles with alcohol in poignant ways. Watching it all made me feel bad for Steve but also immense respect for what he had accomplished before things went downhill for him.I hope more people see this documentary primarily because it contains a Canadian computer graphics legend that so many of us, especially dinosaur and Science Fiction fans, need to know about.The documentary is also a wake-up call to the entertainment industry to change the way it approves or accepts people who don't quite fit into their behavioural mould or expectations.In a business built on Art, it only makes sense to embrace the misfits and outcasts, because those are the people who often possess the most creativity. Case in point, Steve Williams.",

            "storyline": "\"Death by Metal\" (2016) is a documentary on Chuck Schuldiner and his musical journey that started as a pre-teen and ended with his passing in 2001 at the age of 34 from a brain tumor. From 1987-1998 he released seven Death albums with a revolving door of bandmates. His career ended with an album consisting of the final members of Death and an actual singer (rather than a death growler). The new band was Control Denied. Demos were written and four songs recorded without vocals for the follow-up opus when Chuck passed from this plane (you can hear these songs on Youtube, just punch-in Control Denied WHEN MAN AND MACHINE COLLIDE).The many people interviewed include musicians Chris Reifert, Rock Rozz DeLillo, Steve DiGiorgio, Gene Hoglan, Terry Butler, Sean Reinert, Richard Christy and Shannon Hamm, manager Eric Greif, journalist Jeff Wagner and producer Jim Morris, as well as Chuck's sister and mother. Some key musicians are noted but not interviewed, like guitarist James Murphy.It's odd that the singer for Control Denied, Tim Aymar, isn't even mentioned, possibly due to a production decision. I guess you can't have everything, particularly with a limited runtime.Naturally the focus is on Chuck and I like the chronological telling of his journey from album to album with snippets of corresponding songs throughout.Like most thinkers, writers, artists & creative types, Chuck was reserved, driven by his art, preferred to create at home and avoided social drama, which would explain a couple European tours cancelled at the midpoint. The movie elaborates on these things. While all the commenters are respectful of Chuck, it's not all gushing praise. He had his curious idiosyncrasies.In my opinion, Chuck's best piece is 1995's SYMBOLIC by Death, a stunning masterpiece.The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes.GRADE: A.",

            "storyline": "Basquiat's artwork transcended the culture of the streets, circa 1980. He started out as a graffiti artist and rapidly become one of the world's coolest underground painters. The interview footage, if you've never seen clips of Jean-Michel Basquiat, puts the viewer into the perspective of his artwork, and conveys how his ideas were partly influenced from past artists, partly his immediate emotions, and wholly groundbreaking. He became known for crossing out words on the canvas, which indirectly strengthened the meaning of his avant-guard, street poetry. Basquiat was an innovative painter who was ahead of his time. His drive was about being totally original; that is, the very best, when it came to originality. As far as a documentary, \"Jean-Michel Basquiat: the Radiant Child,\" works well. As soon as the director presents the eventful rise and fame of the subject, the film takes a righteous step back to discuss Basquiat's background and influences. In addition, documentaries about a single subject should never depict a person's life in chronological order; it becomes more like a Barbara Walter's special, and we don't want that. I think the audiences's predilection for this film will depend on their fascination for the subject at hand; the chaotic life of an artist, the rise and fall of a famed celebrity. I absolutely adore these stories. They usually start and finish the same, but sometimes, events take the turn for the worse, and the icon dies at a very young age. Jean-Michel Basquiat was only 27 when he died of a hot-heroin overdose. Fame, fortune, and loneliness drove his drug addiction to an unbearable end. When you hear these stories, sometimes these celebrities make it, and sometimes, they never get to live long enough to tell it themselves. Always pray for their recovery. Basquiat's work might have become more famous as a result of his death, but there's never a price too high for a persons life; not fame, fortune, or history in the making. I think the strength of documentary filmmaking deals primarily with the subject. If the viewer is drawn to the central figure, then it's really hard to objectively critique the way a documentary is filmed. Personally, I don't think \"The Radiant Child\" provides strong enough direction, but more importantly, a strong passion for the subject, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and it certainly shows. \"The Radiant Child\" lacks the spontaneity and hipness of \"Exit through the Gift Shop\" (2010), but any art lover, interested in the short, yet successful life of Basquiat, will certainly enjoy this documentary. Basquiat was so daring and conceptual with his work, that when he wanted to explore a traumatic event from his childhood, he would literally paint in the manner of a five year-old child . A child; he was far from it. Radiant; he was above and beyond.",

And perhaps it is. But what is most remarkable about \"Living on One Dollar\" is how well this little documentary is made. It's narrative is perfectly developed, it's tone perfectly shaped. The pace sails along wonderfully, never getting itself stuck by trying to be overly emotional.

There were a couple of points where tears flooded down my face but one particular moment is where the dad is asked a question he doesnt answer and it made me cry like a baby. You will know when you see it.You dont have to come from a mountaineering family to understand loss. The mountains just add another element.But I connected on all levels and I could feel the pain in my chest when hearing the heart breaking stories from survivors. But unlike a lot of \"survivor stories\" there is tonnes of video footage leading up to the moments we all dread.Beautiful and sad is all I can say. Its a solid 9 stars.",

But there is one thing that she does not share in common with most teenage girls: she was born and raised in a nudist club with her mother, step-father and sister. Upon leaving high school, she decides to spend a more interesting summer than most girls who hit the pubs and go out on the hunt for boyfriends: looking for naturists her own age. Her searches on the Internet open her up to a new generation of young nudists who are trying it for their own purposes: a Muslim architect student who closets it from his parents, a young guy who enjoys hiking in the woods naked and tries to cajole his unwilling fiancé into going naked with him, a nude bike ride through the streets of London, a teenage girl who actually got her boyfriend to try nudism first (unlike most relationships where it's usually the guy who is interested and the girlfriend who is reserved). In all it's a cute documentary that paints up the naturist movement in England and America, warts and all including a few questionable characters whom nudists and non-nudists don't want in their lives. But it's going to be a long long time till the masses will finally come around to the nudist's way of thinking about the body and this is a step in the right direction as a whole.",

I'm not talking about Tantric Sex, I'm talking about Baba Dez, sacred sexual healer - the epitome of a crunchy granola,chakra balancing, free loving, Sedona AZ living, hippie Guru.Sex Magic was originally intended as a documentary on Dez's teachings at his Temple in Sedona; However, filmmaker Jonathan Schell requested Dez open up his life to create a film narrative instead, with a focus on the rocky relationship between Dez and \"his beloved\" Mya. Mya had come to Dez from a very broken and abused place in her life; while teaching her the art of sexual healing they fell in love. Mya becomes a skilled sexual healer in her own right and believes in intimate contact with clients, but Dez also practices polyamory, which basically is a fancy name for being extremely promiscuous (Dez has lost count as to how many lovers he's had, somewhere between 1000-2000) Mya isn't comfortable with this aspect of their relationship. On top of that, Dez gets accused by a colleague of being inappropriate with his female clients.The term Sex Magic is the art of manifesting tangible desires through the sharing of sex, while holding the image of what you are trying to accomplish in your mind during the act. Schell said Dez practiced Sex Magic to conjure people willing to participate in sexual healing sessions on film. It worked, be prepared to see quite a bit! The whole thing makes for a very entertaining and enlightening 77 minutes. \"Hold a space\" for this movie if you get a chance to see it!",

I was always curious about his porno films, and SEX AND THE LAW gives us some insight into his playful approach.Purporting to be a documentary, with a winsome femme narrator guiding us through the oddities and hypocrisies of Danish obscenity laws which supposedly got her in trouble personally, it's a light-hearted mockumentary that's hopelessly dated. By the time it was released in America in 1970 it was already dated, as Danish laws had freed up what was permissible and XXX explicitness (unlike the timid and even censored footage shown here) was all the rage in U.S. adult cinemas.Nearly all in black & white (there is a very brief and pointless color interlude at the very end of the feature), SEX AND THE LAW is remarkably similar to Alex De Renzy's breakthrough hit PORNOGRAPHY IN DENMARK. I wouldn't be surprised if Alex had seen the earlier Danish film and gotten inspiration.Both films feature lame \"man on the street\" (and woman) interviews asking a cross section of Danes what they think of porn. We visit dirty book shops for very fake sequences that mock the customers, always purchasing magazines or books \"for a friend\". The narrator tells of her own misadventures, working in porn and even being some sort of guidance counselor (!), which landed her in court. A sex fair in Denmark (led by the Doctors Kronhausen) is covered, just like Alex did.The niceties of what can be shown and what can't is of obvious historical interest, re: late '60s standards in both Denmark and the U.S., and Axel keeps pounding away at the age-old double standard: it's OK if it's art (lithographs of Victorian porn and older) including the statuary and woodcuts of India, Japan, etc., but a no-no if just photos exploiting sex. By the time De Renzy treated the subject, hardcore was fine & dandy in the marketplace, but not here.Axel is tasteful, perhaps overly so in retrospect, showing some simulated sex only in distant silhouetted fashion -very tame. By today's standards the film's content would be R-rated. Like De Renzy, he shows us in detail a porn shoot, in this case couples posed for still photography, including a rough s&m session. The narrator emphasizes that s&m is illegal in Denmark, but makes a convincing case for its existence, on libertarian grounds. Similarly, voyeurism is defended in a lengthy \"peeping Tom\" sequence, natch given the target audience! For me the treat was Axel casting consistently impressive big-boobs actresses in the demo & cheesecake roles, a turn-on even though the footage is pretty tame. There is full frontal nudity briefly on display of both sexes but compared to other docs, Axel's film is a class act.",

The film flows easily from one event to the next, with very coherent interviews with important participants in these events, offering a variety of perspectives. I walked out of that first showing amazed at how much I didn't know about these events, and with a deep appreciation to Loki Mulholland for capturing his mother and the other witnesses on film telling their stories.The film is very suitable for pre-teens and older, who as a result of watching this documentary will feel that they too can change the world.",

Some haven't learned the German language yet.Because of his relaxed style, and we never seem Herr Bachmann getting angry or annoyed, his high-school pupils admire him. On top of that he is witty, warm, playful, challenging and a resolute teacher when necessary. He is interested in his kids and teaches them values such as solidarity and tolerance, perhaps even more important than German and math.Some constructive criticism. With its 3.5 hours, the film is too long, although admittedly, it takes time to get to know a class. The school-outing to a WW2 site could have skipped, IMO. OTOH, perhaps a German director feels it is obligatory to pay attention to this part of history. To me, however, it just was an unnecessary deviation. Apart from that, a warm feel-good film.",

            "storyline": "This documentary film allows us to know what leads a person in the 21st century to decide to lock themselves within four walls for the rest of their life. What is their day-to-day life like, their motivations, their connection to pure nature and exterior life, which has a lot to do with their interior life. A very good documentary that shows us the journey into the interior of men and women through the lives of people who have completely given themselves over to a cloistered life of prayer. The human being is a perfect symbiosis of body, mind and soul. For centuries, many men and women have left everything to give their lives to contemplation. This documentary manages to enter and speak, through detailed interviews, with people who rarely speak a word and places that remain closed to the world: the cloistered monasteries. Competently made by Carlos Blanco and with an enjoyable script by Javier Lorenzo, it is divided into three chapters: ¨Path¨, ¨Truth¨ and ¨Life¨.It is a tremendously spiritual film being full of good feelings, concerning the severity of the cloistered people, their moving sacrifice and pleasant relationships between monks and nuns. It describes his simple and austere existence.Splendid documentary that is presented as a film about the contemplative life, but what it is really about is the Christian life. The best scenes are those in which the priests and nuns appear working, praying and fulfilling their duties under pleasant religious music filled with spiritual and Gregorian chants. What counts is how the encounter with God makes life fully human. It is not a film for professionals of religious life, but for people who can no longer bear the emptiness of a materialistic life full of unfulfilled promises. In fact, many of the monks or nuns involved have ended up in the monastery after an intense life of searching in the world. This is the case of a monk of English origin, who after a difficult childhood became a great artist in New York, married an opera singer and had a daughter. But he remained dissatisfied. His brother committed suicide, as did his father and his father-in-law. His encounter with Christ revealed true Beauty to him and he decided to give his life to Him in prayer and in the work of a monastery.I would compare ¨Libres (2023)¨ to the fictional French film ¨Des Hommes et Des Dieux¨ (2010) by Xavier Beaouvous , another religious film that invites reflection on the nuns and priests in Catholic monasteries who live a severe existence threatened by terrorists, in this case Algerian rebels.Stunning camerawork from photographer Carlos de la Rosa, showing colorful places, he introduces us, among other locations, to the Benedictine communities of the monasteries of Leyre (Navarra) and the Valley of the Fallen (Madrid), to the community of the Cistercian nuns of the monastery of Las Huelgas (Burgos ), of the Cistercian monks of Oseira (Orense), in the oblate convent of Christ the Priest in Madrid or in the Trappist community of San Pedro de Cardeña, in Burgos and the unique experience of the Camaldolese hermits of the Yermo de Nuestra Señora de Herrera (Burgos). The film was well directed by debutant Santos Blanco and produced by Bosco Films and Variopinto Producciones.",

            "storyline": "A good biography of the most interesting American writer of the 20th century. His thoughts on how to come alive are bracing and powerful and we get a full dose of them. What the film lacks is an adequate complement of readings from his work. This is a large gap, a poor decision by the filmmakers. We get some sense of his writing style but not nearly enough. Granted, prose readings can be problematic in terms of filmmaking. So the thing to do is hire a good actor to sit on a bare stage with decent lighting and have him read short excerpts--three or four sentences from at least half the author's works, to give the rich flavor of the prose, which is as sustaining as perfect chowder served in Provincetown. As the actor reads, the sentences can be projected on a screen that's also on the stage. Highly visual. Mailer's words are worth the effort.If you're new to Mailer (does anyone under 30 have any familiarity with him?) you might want to start your education by watching the film \"When We Were Kings\" about the Muhammad Ali vs. George Foreman fight in 1974 (Mailer is a talking head in the film, very effective) and then reading Mailer's short book about the encounter, \"The Fight\" (1975), one of his best works.",

We encounter a woman in distress, as she tells her husband \"Either we go together, or we won't go at all\". We then go to \"January 2020. 19 Months Before The Fall of Kabul\", and are introduced to the woman from the movie's opening scene. Turns out to be Zafari Ghafari, at 26 yo the youngest mayor in Afghanistan of a place called Maida Wardek, about 40 km away from Kabul. \"Drop the weapon and take a pen\", she encourages a crowd. She is \"all in\" on women's rights to education (among other things). The Taliban has issued death threats against her (of course!). At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this documentary is directed by award-winning German director Marcel Mettelsiefen, who apparently embedded with Zarifa Ghatari for 2 1/2 years to bring us the extraordinary look at the life and times of people in Afghanistan, through the lens of this one brave woman, as they struggle in they day-to-day existence, dealing with never-ending threats of violence and worse from the Taliban. The movie also includes a look from within the Taliban, as we witness one of the Taliban commanders' coming and going. The documentary's last 30 minutes (when it all comes crashing down in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan) is jaw-dropping as we watch sheer misery and utter desperation. (Apparently it never leads anyone within the Taliban to wonder as they install a new order of terror which they claim is the \"righteous\" way of life, why millions of Afghans tried to flee the country in the worst possible of ways.)\"In Her Hands\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September to immediate critical acclaim. The movie started streaming on Netflix earlier this week. Please note that the movie's overall rating as currently showing here on OMDb (6.3 from 77 ratings) is misleading, with most of those almost certainly from people who haven't actually seen this (Taliban trolls, I'm guessing). If you want to get a glimpse of what life in Afghanistan was like in the last 18 months or so before the fall of Kabul and its immediate aftermath, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

It was around the time the first 'Batman' movies were coming out, the Tim Burton ones where Jack Nicholson played The Joker. That eventually led him to get an agent and to work all over the world as a Jack Nicholson lookalike ... My dad used to say, 'Even better than the real thing!'

Everyone in the Quad Gods is a quadriplegic by medical classification. I'm a C6 quadriplegic and it's baffling a high level quad like the user critic livemuzek-01941 doesn't understand the actual difference between quad and para. They also aren't a recognizable name in the gaming industry like RockyNoHands. You can find my credentials by just looking me up too, at MikeTheQuad. Big ups to the film and everyone involved for making this wonderful documentary which took years to make. I would recommend anyone that knows of someone that had a severe spinal cord injury. This film is just one example to show them their disability is not the end.",

At the risk of their own lives they are bringing consciousness of female rights to be free from abuse as property as mostly supported from patriarchal and religious culture. Started and active in Eastern Europe, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and now in several other countries. Small numbers of active participants in each country, but determined. Arrested, beaten, abused, placed in inhuman isolation, threatened by police in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia (and all three places with secret Russian police participating).

The contributors to the film are stellar representatives of free journalism and weave a compelling case for ceasing the hounding of Assange.I agree with the previous review that it was overlong and could have done without the overdone verbiage of the last 10 minutes or so. It is well worth watching though and may leave you concerned for the future of a free press and by extension free and fair governments.",

            "storyline": "This is essentially the biography of the only American ever to win the Tour de France, Greg LeMond. He overcame psychological and physical trauma to claim cycling's greatest achievement in the late 1980s. His story is intertwined with other great cyclists, especially Hinault, Delgado and Pignon so we learn a lot about the fierce rivalry that existed in the pelaton at that time and of course, at all times.Greg LeMond was a sporty kid but discovered cycling later than most when he was preparing for a season of snow-skiing. He immediately loved being on the bike and was a natural at road racing, soon winning event after event. His passion soon had him looking towards the great European riders and races, however he was married to his highschool sweetheart in California. For her it was a no-brainer and she accompanied her husband to pursue his dreams in the big roadraces in Spain, Italy and France. His rise was meteoric but the egos of others were not easily overcome, especially as Greg LeMond was carrying the burden of a dark childhood secret. His ambitions were dealt a further, seemingly fatal blow in a family hunting accident, but again, with the unwavering support of his wife, Kathy, he battled on.Greg is now a mature man, wisely reflecting on his career, and Kathy also contributes beautifully to the telling of his incredible story. Of course, for cycling fans this well-constructed documentary is a must-see, but it also opens up some of the mysteries of the big cycling events for those not familiar. They are taken along for the rollercoaster ride that is LeMond's story, one which couldn't be anymore gripping if it were fiction. And The Last Rider is mercifully free of US patriotism and jingoism, so it is highly recommended as a human story for anyone to marvel at. Although simply told, it is so wonderfully full of real tragedy and triumph, heroes, heroines and villains, that it atones for the Armstrong years to come.",

            "storyline": "This is a melancholic documentary, and it begins to play in a completely different way. Unlike all the same pov tracing history docs, \" Heimat Is a Space in Time\" goes into pure poetry, it is slice of history and life. From the point of view of the director, the film traces back on the history of his family through archival memories. He looks back on the events between Berlin and Vienna, from World War I to reunification. The narrative is arranged a little differently and the most important element is the minimalism itself. At the same time, the ease of presentation of the material is coupled with images filled with many symbolism and metaphors that help the narrative flow. It is through the images, looking at everything around through the prism of a past century that we accompany the director and experience all the buzz from the past college years, first love, growing up, world war facts along the bleak and empty territories.Even though the treatment of this documentary evokes comparison with Lakis Papastathis's Letters from America (1972), Sebastian Mez Metamorphosen (2013), Sophy Romvari's Still Processing (2020), Claude Lanzmann's Shoah (2014) and the works of Jenni Olson, Eric Pauwels, Sergey Loznitsa, Donald Winkler, Marie Voignier, Gianfranco Rosi, Catarina Vasconcelos, Robert Beavers, Mercedes Álvarez, Michael Pilz, Cynthia Scott, Laida Lertxundi, Jana Sevciková, Jean-Daniel Pollet, Marie Losier, Nicolas Philibert. But it still has a special magic of its own. Nevertheless, the documentary does not slip into too much of self-indulgence and it unfolds before our eyes with such a great composure. The last part of the film with 'magic realism' completes this picture about attempts to understand the changing geopolitics, Germany and love for it.The film turned out to be incredibly beautiful, Rosie's diary segment was bittersweet, and the cinematography was splendid that I could pause it and screen grab it for wallpaper or would do good for an album art of a Black metal band. Overall, I recommend it to those who love works of arthouse documentaries, regular cinephile might find it too long and boring but I will say that it is holds up till the end.",

This is a very hokey pseudo documentary, produced by military industrial types, designed to scare the crap out of you, to convince you that war is coming, and that we need the give the Pentagon more money to protect us. In other words, this is a total piece of crap that does nothing to further the topic with clear sober intelligent conversation.

Again, sorry for the loss, but this course of events doesn't seem too outstanding, does it?Sonya just devours this suffering, tells in small detail how the hospital called her and she missed the first call, reads out loud the condolences letters that she has been sent. I don't understand, why the watchers need to see this.Come on Sonya, there are children, who lose parents in their childhood! There are ones who never had any!Another unmeasureable suffering that Sonya Ricotti, self-called \"bounce back expert\", has endured, was becoming ill and having to go to the hospital for injections. Really.And - get this - the hospital was the whole 35 minutes away from her home. Unthinkable suffering!The other gurus are just saying a bunch of words about letting go and moving on.

When a student filmmaker offers him the lead role in a short film, Moses embarks on a path of rediscovery, reconnecting with his music, past, and sense of self. Filmed over 15 years, Moses is a testament to resilience, human connection, and transformative power of truly being seen.",

Then don't consider yourself a moral person, you're not simply an ethical person, that's it, so simple!Everyone who uses any form of animal products is supporting these horrific acts. You can't simply close your eyes and say... I love the taste of them!!! You are talking about some animals that are being tortured and suffering every second and guess who's paying for that to be done over and over... YOU!I'm sure a lot of people risk their social status and even their security to film these footage. Future generation with better ethical status will thank them gratefully and remind these years as a horrible stone-age kind of thing.The question is not, Can they reason? Nor, Can they talk?

            "storyline": "CS (Jack) Lewis, an Oxford don who died 40 years ago, is in the news because the latest filmed version of his famous children's novel, \"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\" (filmed in New Zealand, of all places) has become a box office success. Norman Stone, who in 1985 directed \"Shadowlands\", an excellent TV movie based on Lewis's relationship with his American fan and eventual lover Joy Gresham (with Joss Ackland and Clair Bloom in the leading roles), has given us a re-run of that film but this time as a dramatized documentary with Anton Rogers as an elderly Jack Lewis taking us through his story. And it is an interesting story.Jack Lewis came from a prosperous and happy Belfast protestant family (his father was a solicitor) but at the age of 10 his mother, who he adored, died of cancer. He and his brother Warnie were sent away to a succession of nasty boarding schools, until their father decided a private tutor might be the answer and sent Jack to his former headmaster, the elderly but dynamic \"Knock\" who was a teacher of genius. Wounded in the trenches in WW I, Jack went to Magdelene (\"Maudlin\") College Oxford and racked up an almost unheard of triple first in Moderations (Greek & Latin Literature), Greats (Philosophy and Ancient History) and English.. He settled down to the comfortable life of an Oxford don, but his early atheism gave way to deep Christian belief and he produced some notable works on Christian themes, as well as the allegorical children's stories, \"Chronicles of Narnia.\". He had a long and stormy friendship with another great fantasy writer, JRR Tolkien, also an Oxford don.His personal life was a little less comfortable. For 30 years he lived with and supported the difficult and demanding mother of Paddy Moore, Jack's best friend, killed in WW I. Then in 1952 he met Joy Gresham a brash American divorcée in her 30s he had corresponded with, and her sons Douglas and David. At first just friends (though he married her in 1956 so that she could stay in Britain) he fell in love with her after she became seriously ill with cancer. They married again, this time for real. She went into remission and they had a couple of happy years together before she died in 1960. At 62 Jack was a widower with two teenage step-sons to look after.The story is told in flashbacks, with Jack to camera, radiating sincerity, providing the links, and occasional contributions from biographers, scholars and friends, including Joy's son Douglas. Given the producers of the film are the Faith and Values Group, a certain amount of religiosity is present though it would have to be described as a soft sell. What is interesting is the comparison with the earlier \"Shadowlands\"  the play by William Nicholson, Nicholson and Stone's 1985 TV movie mentioned above, and the 1993 movie directed by Richard Attenborough from Nicholson's script. The early works tend to concentrate on the personal story of Jack and Joy, while this version gives more of Jack's life and beliefs. In fact it is vastly more informative.Being a fine writer (\"The Screwtape Letters\" is a masterpiece of persuasion) Lewis became a very influential Christian figure in the 20th century. He is, via the Narnia stories, as widely read as ever. If you want to know what it is to be a Christian he's your man.",

            "storyline": "Though it's one thing to see our excellent military in action, it's pathetic to see that they were sent to a war that President Trump described as Bush's Biggest Mistake in US History. Mr. Trump also added that the US has spent over 7 trillion dollars and that the war in the Arab region brought about the death of over a million men, women and children.This film, like so many other war films about that region of the world, typically avoids mentioning anything about the foolishness of the war. The enemy is never referred to as a ''Patriot'' fighting a foreign Invader of their country, namely the USA. Instead they are dismissed as Insurgents or terrorists.The viewer sits watching from the helicopter as it flies over mainly barren lands and poor areas with low quality buildings, in other words, 3rd World type living standards, The death machines fire their super expensive high tech weapons into whatever is down there. Nobody hears the screaming or sees the collateral damage.and the viewer like the pilots remain insulated from all of that bloody mess.There's no mention in the film that ISIS arose out of and because of this war. Nor is there a hint given that the mayhem and instability these weapons and war created in the region, caused millions of Islamic people to become homeless and later flood into Europe,the USA and other parts of the world.It is films like this that leave out important facts and try desperately to make our troops look like heroes, when in reality, they are men who have to risk their lives to follow orders originated by what President Trump described as, two blundering fools in the White House.Perhaps if films like this were more honest and were to mention real and truthful pertinent facts about a particular war, the world would have fewer wars.We look at the splash screen cover for the film Apache Warrior, and see the choppers coming in at an angle with explosions all around, down below the evil enemies are firing away, guns a-blazing.But in reality we see high tech weapons sneaking through the night toward unsuspecting people, many of them totally innocent and uninvolved. Even the pilots or command center don't know what they've killed below. They hope they got the bad guy but they don't know, nobody does, except the survivors.The next time a semi action documentary film on our Arab war is made, it would contain a much higher quality, if it were to mention that Dick Cheney who mainly engineered the war, was once CEO of Halliburton, a Giant contracting firm that got huge contracts to go in and rebuild the infrastructure that was destroyed in the Arab region.If a film is going to show troop heroes let them also show the anti-heroes who put the troops lives at risk to award contracts to the Military Industrial Complex.The only interesting thing about the film is watching the communication of the fighting forces with command centers and seeing the technical, mechanical and weather difficulties the pilots have to deal with,Unfortunately the fact that over a million people are dead because of Bush and Chaney's war, the film ends up leaving a stench in atmosphere of the real world.",

Henry Blake,died six years earlier and Larry Linville,who played David Ogden Stiers' preceding character Frank Burns,died two years before this special was made(Stevenson and Morgan did act together in the M*A*S*H(1972) season 3 premiere episode \"The General Flipped At Dawn\" when Morgan appeared as the lunatic General Bartford Steele a year prior to Stevenson's departure from the series and Morgan joining as Col. Sherman Potter). This was also the only time that Wayne Rogers and David Ogden Stiers had appeared onscreen together as Wayne had left the series two years before David joined the show. It was not Rogers' first onscreen appearance with Harry Morgan though as,even though he left the series right before Harry Morgan joined as a regular,the two did share a scene in the aforementioned M*A*S*H(1972) episode \"The General Flipped At Dawn\". In all,McLean Stevenson and Mike Farrell were never onscreen together for anything(Farrell joined the show following Stevenson's departure),nor did Stevenson and David Ogden Stiers ever appear onscreen together as Stevenson had left the series two years before Stiers joined the show and had died several years before this special was made. Larry Linville and David Ogden Stiers never made any onscreen appearances with each other as Linville had already left the show when Stiers joined it and Linville passed away two years before this reunion. Besides this reunion special and the documentary special on the series \"Memories of M*A*S*H\"(1991) that aired on CBS in November of 1991 plus several other bios and documentaries on the series with cast interviews and clips from the show,the only other showing of the entire M*A*S*H(1972) franchise to include every single one of the cast and characters from the series was the M*A*S*H(1972) season 7 episode \"Our Finest Hour\" in which Wayne Rogers,McLean Stevenson,and Larry Linville,who had all left the series long before this episode had aired,appear as their respective characters in flashback clips from the show's previous seasons.",

            "storyline": "Ever watch a movie that isn't what it should have been? Such is the case with writer-director Amei Wallach's third feature documentary, which is supposed to be an account of the US government-backed campaign to capture the grand prize for painting at the 1964 Venice Biennale, the world's most influential art exhibition. The thinking behind this effort was to showcase the supposedly superior nature of the nation's art and culture, one in a series of comparable American propaganda initiatives aimed at winning over the hearts and minds of the citizens of the world at the height of the Cold War. The plan here was to secure top honors for the works of artist Robert Rauschenbach (1925-2008), one of the most influential innovators of the emerging pop art movement, who was best known at the time for his \"combines,\" three-dimensional creations that straddled the line between painting and sculpture. This venture thus helped enable the US to become a major player on the international arts scene and did much to change the ways that fine art was exhibited, marketed and appreciated. The problem with this film, though, is that it frequently deviates from its stated intent; its unfocused storyline often jumps about wildly, straying from the thrust of the narrative. In fact, the picture actually works best - and ultimately would have worked better overall - as a biography of Rauschenbach. Indeed, that's the story that should have been told here, given that the artist's life and career are far more interesting than this largely anemic chronicle of the exhibition, a tale that often comes across as scattered, shallow, gossipy and not especially insightful. In short, this is a project that should have been significantly retooled right from the outset. While a segment about the Biennale certainly should have been included as part of such a hypothetical production, there's not enough worthwhile material to make it into a standalone work of its own (at least based on what's presented here). A biography of the artist, on the other hand, would have made for a release worth watching, especially since 'Taking Venice\" frequently veers off onto tangents about its principal that are much more engaging than what the film is supposed to be about. In watching this offering, I was reminded of an anecdote I heard in one of my journalism school classes: A cub reporter was assigned to cover a speech by a public official but returned from the event with nothing to report. When his editor asked him about it, the young journalist said there was no story to tell, because the official didn't give his talk, having been shot by a gunman in the audience. Now there's a message the filmmaker here obviously should have taken to heart.",

This footage shows that the NYPD \"raided\" the after party presumably because men dressing as women in those days was still illegal. Arrogantly and with no seemingly plausible reason, the police officers walked through the party requiring numerous attendees to show their identification, such harassing actions which could have arguably led up to the Stonewall rebellion of 1969.",

At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the first feature-length from British documentary maker Benjamin Hirsch. Here he reassesses the ups (in plural) and downs (also in plural) of a most unlikely soccer plays that was the 6ft7 Peter Crouch. As a pretty die-hard soccer fan in general, I was vaguely aware who he was but seeing it all laid out in this documentary, one cannot help but respect and admire Crouch. And also this: British soccer fans are pretty mean if not worse. I didn't realize that Crouch set the record for most headed goals in the Premier League's history. This documentary also makes clear that outside of soccer, Crouch seems to be a \"jolly good fella\". Bottom line: he is a winner all around, and so is this super-enjoyable documentary.\"That Peter Crouch Film\" recently started streaming on Amazon Prime, and I finally watched it last night. If you are a soccer fan, or simply interested in learning more about one of the oddest players in Premier League history, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",

They saw a trailer it upset them because racism is not real and reviewed it one star. I wish there was a way where you had to verify that you actually saw these kind of movies to review. I bet the reviews through AMC are amazing since every time I see a movie it asks me a review whenever I log into the app after seeing the movie. This was a 5/5 film. I really recommend it.",

Overall, it succeeds in painting a nuanced portrait of Nixon and Watergate, offering a reminder of the importance of accountability in leadership without resorting to sensationalism. It's a well-crafted and insightful exploration of a pivotal moment in U. S. history.",

Of course there are moments when they appear foolish, and some of them are likely just born fools, but that's the nature of an amateur organization. Due to focusing so heavily on the character of individual Minutemen, however, the viewer doesn't get much sense of the scope or effectiveness of their mission. There is certainly no comment from the Border Patrol. The Minutemen themselves don't seem sure if the project is vital or futile, or if the Hispanic trespassers are criminals or pawns. The seemingly common attitude of the migrants that they are entitled to enter, apparently due to the historical claim of the Spanish Crown, makes the matter clear to me. We need more Minutemen, and of course an impenetrable border.",

            "storyline": "In 2023, the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam displayed 28 Vermeer paintings in the largest exhibition ever by this famous Dutch painter of the 17th century.During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful provincial genre painter, recognized in Delft and The Hague. He produced relatively few paintings, primarily earning his living as an art dealer. He was not wealthy at his death, leaving his wife in debt when he died at 43yo (due to the stress after the 1672, a severe economic downturn caused by three invasion of Dutch territories) father of 8 girls and 3 boys with a 44yo wife - he and Rembrand are probably nowadays the names of that era that we remember the most on duct painting.His works were only rediscovered around the 19th century that had an essay saying that he had 66 paintings, but we knows only 34 of them (and three more contested).This documentary rotates about a dozen or so of his paintings discussing the majority of them, analyzed by experts and critics. It also shows some X-ray and other studies on the techniques used my this master of painting (sadly only showed a couple of them)Not the most profound documentary but what others say is a repetition of saying the whole time is truth - he was ahead and different on his time paint thought light mostly than colors, in rich and intricated details - I am most of all amazed how he mastered focus on his pictured present on some parts, blurry on others as we do with analogic cameras and digital cameras on our era.Still very interesting especially if you are a fan of his works or want to know them better. 8.0 out of 10.0 / A-.",

The Organization has done some shady things in the past.The military has very advance air craftsThe overall media can be manipulative and critical thinking skill are important.I have noticed in past few years, there has been a lot of stories about UFO,s our air space. What are the powers that be are trying to distract us from?Pointing out the Military Industrial Complex is very powerful.That there is a Shadow Government made up of Corporations and Political Actions Committees\n(I live in Michigan and there is a county called Ottawa where a small PAC called Ottawa Impacted were able to get their puppets elected to the county board. This should be frightening to any one on how so few can control things)The Bad:Cherry picking from speech's by Ronald Reagan and Dan Inouye.No proof contact was made with Aliens.It is impossible for the government to attempt a fake alien invasion.Hinting 9/11 was a false flag (it was not)The Ugly:I cannot take anything a former Nazi scientist says seriously.Too much of this documentary remained me of the Kurt Vonnegut novel, \"The Sirens of Titan\" where people were kidnapped or went on there own to Mars to be trained to attacked Earth.And there was an old Outer Limits episode where a scientist allows himself to be turned into an alien The plan was to create a mini fake alien invasion. The scientist hoped the fear of an alien invasion would unite the world and bring about peace.I wonder if the people in this doc read that book or saw the OL episode.",

In a world full of potential villains it doesn't paint any of the people it features in such a light: instead it asks two questions: firstly, what is the proper return on venture capital, and secondly, how can Ghana, a country with recently discovered oil reserves, avoid the fate of Nigeria, where oil has proved a curse, its riches taken by a minority willing to ruin the country in order to obtain them? The film can almost convince you that everyone is genuinely trying to do their best for the country; yet in the conclusion, it seems that all those involved in the business, Americans and Ghanaians alike, have struck it rich, too rich one fears. On one hand, director Rachel Boynton could have made a film about casino capitalism. Instead, she's made a film that's insightful, but leaves the politics to the viewer. I'd like to know the views of an ordinary but educated Ghanaian on the situation; but this is still an interesting film.",

As a senior in high school currently going through it, I found this film relatable and eye-opening to the hardships that I and many others are facing.Try Harder! Takes us through the admissions process by following members of the senior class at Lowell High School, a prestigious, nationally ranked school. The students in the film all share the same process, yet different personal experiences which make the process more complex.The stereotypes of immigrant parents reign true in this documentary. It considers different viewpoints on the different aspects of the admissions process - from test scores to essays. I love that the film ponders questions we will never get to uncover such as, if you should be humble in writing your essay or not. It questions whether you should check the \"I do not wish to disclose\" when asked for your race or gender. This film also touches on heavy social issues such as the stereotypes placed on African Americans and their academic abilities, racial discrimination in the admission's process, and the mental health of students in pressurized households.One of students in the film mentions a very powerful message applicable to this situation, but also in any difficult situation - \"People who apply and don't work hard, yet still get in, rubs me the wrong way.\" This quote exemplifies how, during a competition of any sort, you must work hard and overcome those people making it difficult for you to succeed or to be happy. This film promotes positive social behavior and mentions mental health.I give Try Harder! 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults. Try Harder!

Wether one is from a \"survivors' camp\" or a \"perpetrators' camp\" in relation to the Holocaust, or Nakba tragedies for example, trauma is passed on to the children in both situations, and the offspring are then beset with the task of processing what happened in the past through their direct relationship links.

Could Bitcoin serve as a foundational structure to protect moral values and ethics? The test of time continuously pushes Bitcoin to new grounds of adoption, and this documentary indicates Bitcoin is an alternative to the current monetary system. While it builds solid reasoning as to why Bitcoin can be such an alternative, it fails to develop if there are any downsides to massively scaling and adopting Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the documentary provides a valuable view of how Bitcoin aligns with truth by transparency as the foundation for a monetary system. It also plants some questions for the future: Will capitalism evolve? Will the world adopt Bitcoin as currency? Will Bitcoin become the ultimate alpha as a store of value?Time will tell what the future will be and if Bitcoin plays any role. As of 2024, Bitcoin's lifetime has surpassed any given obituaries with increased worldwide adoption and value besides volatility, and that... is Bitcoin's ripple effect.",

This film beautifully follows this storyline and you get to see him go on a real life version of the hero's journey. You learn not only about him as an athlete, but as a man as well, and get to see from his family's perspective just how much of a genuine person he truly is.This film is completely riveting. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you watch Anders and his team willingly (and unwillingly) put themselves in some of the most ridiculously dangerous situations. To witness Anders not only be in one of the harshest environments on the planet, but then also complete what is considered to be one of the most challenging athletic competitions of all time while done in normal conditions, and then have the process take several days is just mind-blowing. He is truly a perfect example of the phrase, \"Limitations are perceptions.\"",

But, when such a tragedy is writ large, as it is in director Guy Davidi's poetic but profoundly sad and quietly infuriating documentary about the Israeli government's heavy-handed indoctrination of its youth for its compulsory military service program, that message comes through with an undeniably enraging impact. With virtually no alternate option available for conscientious objectors - of which there is a steadily growing movement among the country's young population - 18-year-old men and women are forced into either enlisting or facing disgrace and/or imprisonment. And those who are unable to devise a suitable alternative frequently resort to desperate acts to take away the personal pain they suffer in trying to comply with their obligations but are incapable of doing so. Told through home videos and voice-over narrations of the writings of those who tried to fit in but couldn't, intercut with footage from training exercises, government propaganda and battlefield images, the film presents a chilling portrait of an inflexible, merciless military that seeks to brainwash its youth into service, regardless of what their conscience will allow or even whether they're fundamentally capable of carrying out the role of soldiers. As one objector poignantly observes, if the youth of the nation can't change a system like this, who can?

            "storyline": "The historical perception left behind by Golda Meir is very different in Israel and in the Jewish Diaspora. The Jews of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as well as those in the United States remember her as one of the remarkable figures of the founding generation of the State of Israel, the immigrant who came as a young woman in the Mandatory Palestine and became an activist for independence, later a minister and the first (and the only one so far) woman Prime Minister of Israel, with a significant contribution to the emigration of Jews from Europe to Israel and their integration in the new country. The majority of Israelis keep of her a completely different image, that of the failed prime minister largely responsible for the 'surprise' of the Yom Kippur war that resulted in the deaths of more than 2,000 Israeli soldiers, missing peace opportunities with Egypt that could have avoided war, showing political shortsightedness about the Palestinian problems or about internal issues such as the social and economic status of Sephardi Jews. Few talk about her in Israel in recent years. The documentary film 'Golda', which premiered this spring at the Docaviv Festival, made by a trio composed of Sagi Burnstein, Udi Nir and Shani Roznes, may reopen the debate about this controversial personality. I saw the film in one of its first public screenings at the local cinematheque.The Israeli television archives provide surprises to documentary filmmakers and make us nostalgic for a period when politicians - including prime ministers - came to discuss with reporters, sharing with the public their memories as well as opinions on the current affairs. That was the case of the documentary film 'Ben Gurion, Epilog' which was screened a few years ago, this is the case with 'Golda' where a 1978 interview, shot off-the-record a few months before Golda's death, and accidentally found in the TV archives, provides the structure on which the film is built. Golda refers in the interview to the 1969-1974 period and the main moments that defined her tenure as the prime minister. It was a succession of painful crisis. She led Israel in a time when the country spiraled down from the euphoria of the victory in the Six-Day War to the existential threat during the Yom Kippur War and the economic and moral depression that followed. Golda's images and voice in the interview are combined with sequences from the filmed actuality journals and the testimonies of people who were close to her during that period - politicians, journalists, family members. One of the points that can be reproached to the authors is that those who speak are mostly selected from the political sectors of the Israeli left, or those who have reasons to have remained resentful of her. At least by now, at least in Israel, she does not seem to have too many fans in posterity.My guess is that 'Golda' the movie will also be perceived differently in Israel and abroad. Many Israelis (and the commentaries in the discussion that followed the film, with Udi Nir's participation, confirmed this) will argue that the portrait is too \"humanized\" in relation to the historical mistakes of Golda and their consequences. In Diaspora, the film will create amazement among those who keep Golda in their memories as a positive figure, one of the founding parents of the re-born Jewish nation. I think that one of the merits of the film is that it helps the viewers understand that some of her limits - ideological dogmatism, political blindness, prejudices towards Arabs and Jews of Sefardic origin - have the sources in her education and personal history on one hand, and the age which eventually caught up with her on the other hand. Even if the balance is inclined towards the negative aspects, the film also shows some of the qualities of character and political positions that we can appreciate: the total dedication to the Zionist cause (as she perceived it), the focus on the social issues and her contributions to building a 'welfare state' in the 50s, the care for the soldiers sent to risk their lives to implement government policies, her personal modesty, and her simple style of life and work. At the end of the discussion co-director Udi Nir was asked what his feelings about Golda are after working for three years on the making of this film. His answer, half ironical, was that in perspective, looking at those who followed her, his appreciation is positive.",

Most frightening is the man's smiling son proclaiming that he is yet to decide if he will follow in his father's footsteps.The balance is brought into this picture through interviews with the sentencing judge, a female journalist, and an interview with an unidentified prostitute.  These people are used to contrast the self-righteous attitude of the killer, and also give a very moderate view of the social state of Iran.  The film also serves to highlight the plight of workers in the sex industry where prostitution is not only illegal, but can be punishable by stoning.Being a mild dilettante in the area of serial killers I found it fascinating to see the parallels between sociopaths in western society, and the gentleman portrayed here.  The mildness with which he discusses his murder of these women jarrs with the physical violence demonstrated in the photos of the cadavers.The film is an excellent, if extreme, example of how all countries, christian or muslim, suffer from the similar problems of hate, and fear.",

I do wish the movie talked a bit more about the effect or mechanism of drama therapy, as this technique should be popular.The pacing can be slow at times, but there were many strong and hopeful moments, especially when we started watching the scenes.Overall, an amazing documentary that was both refreshing and powerful. 8-8.5/10.",

It is beautifully shot, but it goes from uninteresting discussion to uninteresting discussion, dispersed by some enviromental scenes shot from a car. The music, with some exceptions, stays ambient or is gone. Some scenes are definitely staged, while I believe that some scenes are not. As I read from an interview, the film team had 10 days at every location. Maybe the movie ahould habe been shorter. It is a cool time capsule, maybe, but I have more fun watching a reality docu such as \"Armes Deutschland\" where the people seem more relatable and more interesting things happen.",

Many young girls would turn their backs on the motorsport industry at this stage.Not Renee. Her supporting Dad told her to fight for what she she wanted and to ignore their comments. Those wise words worked well for her. I do not know many females who would get past the Go-Kart treatment.In her Supercars career the bullying and misogyny continued. She decided her love of racing had gone.Re-entering the sport, getting her own car, her own sponsor, and joining OnlyFans just seemed to make her more of a target.This is eye-opening - I think all women and supporters of women should be appalled and angry.

In addition to one's natural born abilities, the film shows the importance of mentors and the support of friends and family required to sustain an individual in their quest to achieve their dreams.

What will be left for the future ? What do we leave after us anyway when we pass away? Many questions to ponder is silence of this almost subtle documentary.I am glad I saw this documentary, it might surprise you in a way it is done, beaus it doesn't concentrate on counting the countries or following the route of the journey, it's about a sense of it all.",

I missed the first 20 minutes of the movie. When I started watching, the man was singing a song to his wife and rubbing her knee. It came to me very interesting to watch the daily life of a very old Korean couple. After million-dollar artificial Hollywood movies, this was so natural, full of romance, love, grief and dread. Their house, dresses, beds, the nature and everything was so real. I am still in doubt whether this was a documentary or a movie. Did the director know the ending before? Or did he intentionally wait for certain events to occur in order to finish his documentary? It is too bad that there is not much info about this movie on IMDb.com, not even a poster. Whatever it is, as a whole this movie is extraordinary and praiseworthy.",

No matter our sexuality, no matter what drives us ... we have hopes, we have dreams. We deserve to be seen, we deserve to be heard. You do not have to agree with what the people here think or say. You may even be disgusted at one point or another (there are two very explicit scenes in this - not to titilate, not that it would do the trick for me anyway, but to be in your face - again no pun intended).You really can't be sensitive and you also have to be open minded ... going with the flow. The story told is that of many individuals ... and again the focus is on making us realize that deep down differences are there - but no one deserves to be hated upon .. or worse! The message is clear .. what is not clear: the audio on the interviews that are being made in a room ... I know this is low budget, but it may take you out of the movie.On the other hand the club scenes or rather the music is amazing ... if you are into that of course. The editing is very well done and even when this feels kind of random at times ... it is not. Still this is not for everyone ... be sure this is something you actually want to watch.",

It may be morally repugnant, but it's apparently not illegal to be 50yo and have a 12 year old lover. It's also apparently not illegal to live in a UK brothel in very precarious conditions. What is described here as victims do not identify as victims, and refuse help, whether they're of legal age or not.I suspect this was a very safe documentary to make, given there was no reference to organized crime or organized rings. We just hear of a handful of cases where the girls essentially say they're not victims.I guess a solution is education, good parenting and a nurturing environment? But if it's not illegal, i dont think it makes much sense trying to arrest people, because a judge or police can't do miracles.I suspect the Romanian police is often corrupt, but this is not addressed. I suspect there's a mafia doing the trafficking, but it's not addressed.Overall, a very underwhelming documentary that reminds us that prostitution is the oldest job, and that apparently pimping is very lucrative and comparatively safe.",

            "storyline": "I had a pleasant time viewing For Love & Life: No Ordinary Campaign. The mood, editing, and celebrity cameos make this an excellent watch overall.This documentary follows Brian Wallach & Sandra Abrevaya, a couple from Chicago, who meet and fall in love while working during Obama's 2008 campaign. Shortly after starting their family; news of Brian's ALS diagnosis turned this family's world upside down. However, Brian and Sandra were not going to let ALS stand in their way. This film follows the mass ALS movement sparked by Brian and Sandra, and how this couple's journey gave a voice to the millions of people suffering with the disease and how they also brought attention to the US's broken healthcare system.I love the uplifting mood this documentary takes - the music and editing perfectly captivate the success and struggles that both Brain and Sandra faced while fighting for ALS. One scene that really stuck with me is when Brian and Sandra were preparing a speech that they were going to give to the government urging them to make the drugs that could help the symptoms associated with ALS accessible for all. The music by Emily Rice really adds in creating a suspenseful, yet captivating moment. As for the editing, supervising editor Miranda Yousef makes us feel immersed in this film with its very smooth transitions, transitions between interviews, personal video recordings, and animated info graphics. Lastly, I was very pleased to see celebrities such as Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Priscilla Chan, and countless others share their positive encounters with Brain and Sandra and the different ways in which they all support their campaign.The film's message is that when you encounter a problem, no matter how hopeless you may feel, there is always a solution that can often end up helping others along the way. This message is explored throughout the film and, even when discussing their trials and tribulations, this messaging remains true. The only thing to note is that there are some cuss words that are used.I give For Love & Life: No Ordinary Campaign 4 out of 5 starts and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases on Prime Video on May 28, 2024. If you're looking for a new documentary to watch I definitely recommend you check this one out! By Tia O., KIDS FIRST!",

So not only did she make something of herself intellectually while incarcerated (and in spite of suffering from FAS), but she also grew emotionally, spiritually, and socially. THAT is why mercy is required for this case. She was a child. The ignorance on this review page is astounding. And the \"it wasn't exciting enough\" comments make me wonder why anyone expecting an action movie out of a documentary would then choose to watch a documentary instead of an action movie,",

As a nation still grappling with its most recent wars on the big-picture, foreign policy level, this documentary narrows in one unit. It recounts the lives of 17 Marines of the 1st Battalion 5th Marines killed over the summer of 2011. This is an in-your-face, unflinching look at the results of war from the most personal level--the surviving families. One of the battalion's Marines Anthony Marquez carved a beautiful, life-size battlefield cross for each of the families. Now, 10 years after those 17 deaths, Marquez revisits each family. The gut-punch of each visit is palatable. The families' pain is as raw 10 years later as it was the day Marine Casualty Officers delivered the terrible news. Later in the doc, there is an additional shock that is unbelievably moving. I'm not revealing it. I encourage everyone-especially those who do NOT have family serving in the military-to understand what the depth of that service means. This is a beautifully done doc that handles a lot of issues within its short 90 minutes. You won't regret watching it. It'll stay with you a long time.",

            "storyline": "This well-paced documentary brings the story of \"the birthplace of hostage negotiation\" to life in a way that is compelling, nerve-wracking and thought-provoking. Told strictly in the words of those involved, it colorfully depicts an intense two-day standoff in 1973 between NYC police and four young African American men who hold up a sporting good store in an attempt to obtain guns, ironically for self-protection. Things go wrong and a hostage crisis ensues. By interviewing participants from all sides, the film drives deeply into mindsets and attitudes, gradually opens into broader ideas behind conflict resolution, and ultimately builds a strong argument for understanding and empathy in a world fraught with enmity.",

Yes, the people featured in the movie did wonderful jobs raising funds but no, I'm sorry, you just don't go into the the non-profit sector looking to make money. Anything above your salary should go towards helping your cause. Your reward is the satisfaction of knowing you helped others. Your reward is knowing you'll be rewarded in the afterlife if you believe in those things. Giving yourselves large salaries gives the impression that you're really not in it for the cause at all - like when I go to these Earth Day/Animal group fundraisers and I see all of their employees eating meat and dairy!

With some construction there running late, Jimmy picked up a hammer and helped finish the drum riser just in time for the gig. Not long after that, The Triple Threat Revue played there. It was from stuffing quarters into Stubb's jukebox on the Saturday afternoon of that first gig that Stevie picked up the correct lyrics to Tin Pan Alley, which would later appear on his first album. And it was that same afternoon that Stevie plugged in and played an instrumental version of Little Wing, with an audience of only four people - two patrons, the cook, and a friend of the owner.",

So for me, this wealth of archival footage represents less an excursion into dreary eyed nostalgia, but rather a fascinating, vicarious experience. It is unfathomable to think that this is a part of our human heritage, and the film leaves the impression of being a document of society, culture and politics that's out of this world. This other-worldliness is achieved through the exclusive use of archival footage, to the detriment of any present-day commentary. The biographical tale of Ceausescu leads us through several decades of communist Romania, and is bound by the trial and execution of the former dictator. Surprisingly, although my knowledge of recent Romanian history is fairly limited, there was little actual information in the the events and moments portrayed which I was unfamiliar with. I'm not sure that's a good thing, for such a long runtime - all it says, to me, is that you should probably not watch this documentary if your aim is solely to gain a straightforward understanding of history.What it does do very well, is synthesize the essence of what the public frame of mind was at the time. It ebbs and flows beautifully, from the fascination of the Western world with Ceausescu after his stance on the invasion of Prague, to his ultimate isolation within the communist block. In this, as well as in much of the propagandistic materials made for public consumption, there is a strong sense of falsehood meshed together with a (willing) naivety of the everyday folk. The film is at its best when it manages to effectively contain these paradoxes of truth, the double-standards of pre-89 communist dogma, and the absurdity of turning a mildly charismatic, semi-literate individual into an egomaniac with absolute power.In between all these moments, you've got Ceausescu delving into sheer silliness - with the cherry on top being his speech on how Romania will only return to capitalism when \"pigs fly\", then joking on the advances of genetics only to realize this is not quite the right thing to say and reinforcing the initial statement with raised pitch and ample gesticulation. There are many scenes like this, of various sizes, that shape Ceausescu as a character and the warped world-view provided by public television. At three hours, one could argue the documentary is overlong, as certain elements become repetitive. One can also argue that in their repetitiveness, these elements bear different meanings, according to the wider context of their occurrence, sort of a seasonal aspect of the biographical story.Whichever way you look at it, there is so much to see and experience in Andrei Ujica's film, that you are guaranteed to not be left indifferent by it.",

He knows his identity from papers, but doesn't remember a single thing or face. The film crew follow the tracks of his travel to China, to find out more about him, and help him finding back his identity.Vind, originally called Øyvind, suddenly got lost while he was in China. After some months he is found, but he doesn't recognize even his parents or what he likes to do, his own sexual preference, the routine of brushing teeth, or hasn't even an understanding of seasons changing. His complete hard drive is blanked out.The film is not only about the very rare diagnosis of retrograde amnesia, it is also about reconstructing a life. Vind wakes up on a train in China, with no memory what so ever, and realizes that he has some mechanical memory, like writing on a keyboard. But he also have to struggle with friends not believing him, actually thinking he is faking the whole thing. We meet his family and friends, telling about the experience where he feels more Chinese than Norwegian.I wasn't too interested in watching this film, and didn't go to cinema to see I, bu bought it on DVD, and waited more than a year before I put it in the player. But it's interesting as a documentary on a rare case, and quite good narratively done.",

I relocated to Chi-town from Inglewood in '92 and ended up living in this small hick town called Kankakee for about 6 months in '96. I was 22 years old then and Kankakee was sewed up by my big cousin who ran a crew of Vice Lord's down there and they was moving major weight. Dehaven's story of how he touched down in Maryland reminded me of those days. The summer of '96, I couldn't wait for Jay-Z's classic debut album, \"Reasonable Doubt\" to drop and I copped it day one!I always heard Jay shout out his ace boon, Dehaven on albums and wondered who this cat was. You could feel their closeness in Jay-Z's early songs. Fast forward to Jay-Z becoming one of the greatest hustlers the rap game has ever known. He fell out with Dame, but seemed to take a lot of his day one's with him to the top like Ta Ta. We heard him shot out Emory and set him straight when he got out of jail, as expected. So, as a fan and someone who understands the streets, I always wondered why the cat who gave him the game (Dehaven) wasn't along for the ride.When I saw Dehaven's YouTube rant years ago, I hoped Jay would have had a sit down and drop a few mill on him, just on the strength of their brotherhood. It never happened, so this documentary tells the story from Dehaven's vantage point on why he felt slighted, but it also reveals why Jay may have cut ties as well. Brothers fight, but there is often reconciliation. Definitely worth the watch if you are a true Jay fan from day one and know what Dehaven meant to the young Shawn Carter!",

A CEO who has been arrested and charged but not yet convicted of embezzlement, smuggles himself out of Japan, via a corporate jet, by hiding in a big box. Its stuff out of a novel.It is a well-made documentary but given most documentaries made today are pretty good anyway, to be exceptional it needs to give the viewer as many facts and let them decide on the conclusions. The problem with this film is that I found it wanting in facts.We are told the rot set in when Ghosn was informed of 3 employees at Renault who leaked trade secrets on electric cars to the Chinese. So, Ghosn sacked them. Only then it was divulged the 3 employees were innocent and the whole thing was made up. People were questioning Ghosn's integrity. The way I saw it - who was the dude who made up the lies? Why was not the investigation about the source of the lie? Was Ghosn part of the conspiracy? Where was the evidence to support this if that was the case? The documentary had fewer answers than we needed. It was all up in the air with all the wrong question asked.Ghosn than got in hot water because of his high salary (and a very lavish party he threw), but again, did he break the law? It may not be ethical but what he was doing was not illegal. So jealously plays a large part in his downfall. Ofcourse, the people seeing green could not get over the fact they were still in a job because of Ghosn, not inspite of him. This was the man who turned around a huge loss-making company into a profitable one. The fact he did it twice, for Renault and Nissan, says a lot about Ghosn business prowess and intelligence. Then again, given we are talking about the French and Japanese psyche, that could go in some way to explain why he was hated. Being of Arab origin, he just wasn't one of \"us\". To its credit the documentary address this.The biggest issue I had was the lack of evidence presented about Ghosn's presumed embezzlement or possible tax avoidance. No facts were supplied. We were just told the Renault business set up numerous subsidiary companies, but we are also told other car manufactures do the same, so I am not sure why this was a big deal then? It was through these subsidiaries that Ghosn accumulated wealth, but no details were supplied on how the alleged embezzlement operated, how much was siphoned and who else was implicated?I came away knowing less about Ghosn's charges than I did going into it. The documentary slants on the side of presumed innocence which given the absolute lack of evidence against the man, is the only position to take.The only fact I came away with is the 99% conviction rate of people arrested in Japan and that goes to explain why Ghosn fled.",

I enjoyed the cinematography (after all, it has Alexandre Fuchs written all over), the interviews, the whole approach, etc. What I did not like was its somewhat over hyped tone in respect to MS-13. It's as if these media portrayals, although they're not glorifying a gangster's life style, are still selling out 'MS -13' as THE most dangerous gang. I mean, come on, it's too hip for its own good. (But, come to think of it, so were the Bloods or the Crips).After you see this, go check out on 'Ross Kemp on Gangs', an equally interesting piece of work, as well.",

Those who are too young to remember International Male may have a difficult time believing it existed.Two first-time filmmakers interviewed the founder of International Male (just in time) as well as many of the models and former employees. I would love to know the backstory of how this film was made.This very light topic does not warrant a lot of screen time. Clocking in at nearly and hour and a half, I was ready for it to wrap up long before it did. The best parts were when the folks who were there were allowed to tell their stories, often to the B-roll of excellent vintage photos. Unfortunately, the filmmakers fell into the trap of adding contemporary and (sort of) well-known people, to try to make the movie seem current or something. This was not needed and the movie drags each time it takes us away from the catalogs and model shoots to folks like Carson Kressley (the most obnoxious cast member from \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" which seems more dated now than International Male) and social media \"influencers.\"I get the impression that the filmmakers took their subject a little too seriously. It's too bad, because with stricter editing, this could be a \"must see\" film for its target audience.",

I have never seen tiger footage that looks so great and is so unguarded with long takes that lets the natural action unfold as opposed to the usual Nature Documentary editing.TIGER 24 is not a Nature Documentary. This is more of a narrative documentary with a murder mystery and a message about the ground reality of conservation.Definitely watch on a big screen or projector to appreciate the photography. My partner and I have a small home theater system so the film looked and sounded awesome. Music is really great too.",

With a declassified memorandum, top-flight experts commenting on the background of JFK's administration and the Cold War, and combined with memorable film clips, it makes a compelling argument that Kennedy's quest for world peace made him a target of enemies within our own government. Kennedy wanted to trust his gut and find ways to extend an olive branch to Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev, but received terrible advice from his hawkish colleagues. JFK: A President Betrayed will stand proudly among all other respectable and responsible journalism on the subject.",

The only segment discussed that did not fare well was the medical community (regarding the patient who was misdiagnosed at Mayo Clinic). It doesnt go terribly deep but it does cover a lot in an hour. I also appreciated the history of anxiety treatment as well as the advertising that was discussed.",

His strong convictions often get him in trouble with his government.This film is praiseworthy for various reasons. One is its courage in exposing government abuse in a part of the world that is rightfully notorious for its human rights abuses. Another reason to praise the film is its fascinating human subject.Ai is very likeable and proves to be a great example of courage in how he lives his life. When he is praised for this courage, he gives a fascinating rebuttal to this compliment.The film covers the period of 2008-2011 with some flashbacks when Ai lived in New York City in the 1980s. His main concern in this film is an earthquake in the Sichuan region in 2008 where several children were killed in a badly built school. Many of his art projects are around this subject and the government's desire to cover up as much as possible about these events.Considering the power of the Chinese government, it's easy to be cynical. The film shows by the end that there may a bit of hope while still remaining realistic. It is also informative in that it gets into the mind of an artist. While some works of art seem odd at first glance, the artist's explanations make the works more understandable and even fascinating.",

Some of his victims are interviewed, one personal assistant and some insiders in the\nadult film industry who defend the man's actions saying that the whole groping and touching during events is something that female porn would want him to do. So, there you\nhave the two sides of the story except for the man himself who didn't replied BBC's request for an interview.As said, everything is so rushed and brief that it's hard to form a whole view about the case and/or we feel as if there's plenty of things missing. Basically, you\nget more information on the internet or the news than watching this special report. It's quite good in the little things it has to present related with the case, but when\nthe crew start to follow and film the porn set, some interviews with the people in the industry and their idiotic and shallow points of view is that things get distracting -\nand that includes some of the victims when talking about her previous work routine (and it gets weird that the victims who appear here are not the ones who denounced Jeremy).The best interview comes from the Rolling Stone reporter who broke the case, her investigation was quite serious and she's very insightful about everything she covered.The way things are described regarding his case it all feels like a monumental case of epic proportions that could only be fairly covered had it been an Netflix\nminiseries in several parts. Just half an hour is not enough and it only serves audiences with short span of attention or people who don't like spending too much time\nwatching something. I liked it because it informed me of plenty of things I haven't heard about the case...which is as of now he might get away with murder after a dementia\ndiagnosis. 7/10.",

Shot in the city of Parma, the movie examines in slow precise details the workings of love, especially among society's rejected, physically and mentally challenged, socially excluded  and otherwise loveless. It does this with a spirit of affection and not pity.\nOne has the sense in watching this film that one is peering surreptitiously into the privateness of others, their near-masturbatory ecstasies and very private joys.  But instead of shock, the feeling is one of overall tenderness for love in all its varieties. Who does not deserve love? The almost voyeuristic nature of the movie aroused antipathy in some quarters.I saw this movie in a video projection of its shorter feature-length version at the Roman movie theatre (Azzurro Scipioni) owned by the film's creator, Silvano Agosti, and its message and tone made a great impact on me, despite the fact that many of its details are no longer recollected.  I do not believe it has ever been shown in the United States.  I would certainly love to see it again.Silvano Agosti was a collaborator on other films by Italian avant-garde and leftist directors, was producer of Piavoli's IL PIANETA AZZURRO, and his 1975 film MATTI DA SLEGARE, made in collaboration with Marco Bellocchio and others, was shown at the New York Film Festival.",

Stasi FC shows the reach and extent of a controlling state - rather than those worst affected.Stasi FC is also commendably short, it packs a pretty big punch over one episode - thus avoiding the irritating habit of late, the one where most documentaries are stretched out way too far.Stasi FC is not a \"must see\" but it does offer a compelling glimpse into times, one wishes were, of the past.",

            "storyline": "Art defies logic. Market forces defy logic. The combination of art and market which is the market of art cannot but defy logic. This may be one of the reasons controversial works of art like the ones created by contemporary artists like Damian Hirst, Jeff Koons or Maurizio Cattelan reach prices that could cover the cultural budget of half of the countries in the United Nations, while their quality or good taste is very much open for discussion for many other artists and experts, and refuse to resonate with scores of amateurs of art, more or less connoisseurs. This film is about Maurizio Cattelan, one of the greatest provocateurs in the history of art. I personally like many of the things that he made, but there are quite a bunch of friends whose opinions I respect and who consider him an impostor, and I can understand why other people may be offended by images of the pope struck by a meteorite, or of Hitler kneeling in penitence. What cannot be denied is that Cattelan is a master of image building, and even if conceptual art is not my cup of tea, I cannot deny success, measured in fame and dollars his works earn in public art sales.One needs to be cautious with a documentary like \"Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back\" directed by Maura Axelrod. Apparently, it's a bio-artistic documentary, the kind of these projected in museums as a supporting material for a major retrospective of an artist. It describes the biography of the artist, using a combination of testimonies and cartoons in the classical Disney style. It features the sister of the artist, his ex and current girlfriends, art collectors and critics who (at least some of them) happen to be his friends, gallery owners and experts who work for the Cattelan Archives. It talks about the raise of a young artist of humble origins, the challenges in building his career and public image, his works, their price in the market, whether their value comes close or has any relationship with the price. The artist himself talks - sometimes enigmatically - about his art. Controversies that were each milestones in his career are mentioned, although none of his sharp critics, not to speak about detractors, is offered screen time. The film ends with the announcement of his 'end of career' which happened in 2011.But then, let us pay more attention. Some of his friends and art experts seem to read texts prepared in advance and to play their own role. Cattelan himself in the film is ... not Maurizio Cattelan, but his friend Massimiliano Gioni playing (very credibly) the artist's role. His 'end of career' in 2011 after the retrospective at Guggenheim does not seem to be final. As it is being said in the film, the goal of Cattelan's work is not making art, but succeeding in art. So, this film, \"Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back\" may be another of his conceptual works of art, another stair in the pyramid he is building with his own life and art career. Art or \"art\". Whatever. Or maybe just a sharp critic of the whole art system. As with many of works created by Maurizio Cattelan, you are never sure when watching this film about what you are exactly seeing.",

            "storyline": "I recently watched Highway of Tears (2015) on Tubi. The documentary follows a Canadian highway in Native American territory frequently traveled by truckers and people heading to Alaska. Unfortunately, this highway has been the site of numerous unresolved cases of missing and murdered Native American women for decades, with little to no resolution from local police.Directed by Matt Smiley (For Love), the documentary provides an impressive backdrop and delves deeply into the storyline. There are fascinating subplots about Native American culture, their approaches to life, and thoughts on community. However, the interviewing and editing are inconsistent and could have been significantly better. The presentation of questions, gathering of information, and portrayal of locals could have been much improved.In conclusion, Highway of Tears has a compelling story worth viewing, but better execution could have made it a masterpiece. I would score this a 6/10 and strongly recommend it.",

            "storyline": "There's something sad about how some of the interviewees here talk about Brian Wilson in the past tense, because the man is still around, and he's still creative and engaged in music. Maybe they're subconsciously saying they think Brian Wilson today is divorced from the Brian Wilson of the 60s, but if so, that's a little unfair. It's not a slight against the documentary - more against the interviewees, even if they didn't realise they were doing it.One thing that did bug me was how they didn't subtitle one of the interviewees who spoke in Spanish. Might just be a problem with the version available to be rented off YouTube, but the captions only offer a very unhelpful \"speaking foreign language\", which is pretty disrespectful to the guy (Gustavo Dudamel) and comes across lazy to the viewer.Otherwise it's a nice music documentary. Not much info Beach Boy fans won't already know, but lots of good archive footage and new footage with Brian Wilson himself, who's an interesting and sympathetic subject for a documentary.It's nice to see him continue to battle his personal demons and continue to live his life now almost at the age of 80. And I liked the bond he has with music journalist Jason Fine, with their conversations being necessary in this documentary, as it's acknowledged that Wilson struggles with traditional interviews.So overall it's a nice but not completely remarkable music documentary. I'd still get it to a 7/10, because I do really love the music of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, and being a big Bruce Springsteen fan, I liked seeing him fanboy out over The Beach Boys in his interviews here.",

Fire In The Night focuses on the now middle aged to elderly survivors of the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in 1988 where only 1/4 of the crew survived. It's bizarre how this isn't an event that's already been made a Hollywood film because Fire In The Night is incredibly cinematic with its use of news reel, talking heads and re-enactments. It's made me realize the influence of Man On Wire on filmmaking as it seems the best docs have re- enactments now. Here they truly provide a vivid picture of how these men survived against near impossible odds. It's truly emotional watching them speak and I always love stories of truly ordinary people, especially Brits, being heroes. Although this documentary doesn't break new ground, it utilises the best contemporary techniques today to create a moving and informative picture. Definitely a recommended film for the year.8/10",

The energy intensity of many of these solutions is a key problem that was not covered, whilst the prohibitive cost of installing and maintaining others, particularly in developing countries, was not really mentioned. Furthermore, the biggest anthropogenic uses of water, e.g. for irrigation, provide some of the greatest opportunities to reduce water use, so that using marginal sources to reach the very high levels of purity required for drinking may not be required. But innovations in irrigation which dwarf other savings were hardly mentioned at all. It's great to see this massive issue in the popular mainstream, and I credit the creators with achieving that, but a more thoroughly researched sequel would be helpful in due course.",

The famous German is not physically at the meeting, but his spirit is present throughout the whole movie.Between insightful discussions and fast-pace real-life race action, beautifully filmed \"Heroes\" goes even faster than watching a Grand Prix. From rarely seen footage (personal and racing) to famous race action, this (close to) 2-hour movie is a must-see for motor racing fans, sports addicts and anyone who might not be interested in racing.",

Absolutely nothing about the famous Bill Clinton Painting that was in Jeffrey Epsteins Entrance hallway, The Painting of Bill Clinton was of him in a Monica's Dress sitting in a chair with his legs crossed and pointing straight at you. It was almost like Epstein had this painting made to say to Bill Clinton \"I gotchuh\" like he had some dirt on him or something. This Documentary was basically pointless and a waste of an hour.

Some stories don't get as much attention as others though, and I would've really liked to see more of the perspective of teachers, and social workers involved in these children's lives. It very straightforwardly and urgently calls our attention to the issue, but lacks any analysis of certain plans or prescriptions that could remedy the situation.",

The main purpose of this documentary is to shine a light on the various conspiracies out there and see which ones American's most believe were behind the murder. From what we're told by the narrator, The History Channel did the largest survey ever in regards to the murder of the president and this show presents all the findings. If you're into one of the conspiracies then you're really going to enjoy this film because pretty much every rock is looked under including there being a second shooter, Oswald being attached to the mafia and then there are some really wild theories about Kennedy being killed due to him asking too many questions about the government's knowledge of UFOs. Yes, some think Kennedy was killed because of aliens. There's also some bizarre stories about the driver of the limo turning around and finishing Kennedy on that final head shot. The Mafia, the Catholic church and various other theories are looked at and discussed in great detail. I really thought this was highly entertaining on so many levels. For starters, it's interesting to see that the majority of the people simply don't trust the government, which is somewhat scary. There's also talk about everyone Kennedy upset in his short years in the office and why there are currently over two-hundred theories on who killed him and why. There's even details given as to why Oswald was the only shooter. Fans of history will certainly enjoy this film as there's quite a bit going on and a lot of great opinions expressed.",

Even if duration of the film wraps around only 70 minutes, the long, static takes make the film seem to last longer.It is rather a depressing image of one of the least human-friendly places on earth, a postcard from hell, made with precision and factual adherence. Not very groundbreaking stuff for people interested in ongoing climate catastrophe, but still an important image and reminder for what is about to come if our leaders will not wake up.Watched at Docs Against Gravity 2022.",

Maccabee a true star quality and truly one of the great ones. Richard Wilikinson who played the part of Scipio did a great job. Writers /Producers Hyman and Mcpherson truly did hit a home run with this show. Vin Diesel should take notes for his up and coming epic 'Hannibal Barca'.",

Surprised me some! Sure they gloss over some very difficult ideas but I think they had to... it's not that kind of a movie (I should know, that's often my palette).Specifically, I've read enough reviews critiquing the landmines they must navigate given the nature of subject matter and feel that's somewhat unfair as one can't win no matter how they depict the mentally challenged, no matter how serious it is or to what extent.Let's be fair, I'm certain there are as many varied stories as there are people, so it's rational to depict whatever one you responsibly tackle.It's far too PC to rip everything apart these days. Sure gets old!I really thought the daughter was an exceptional actress and yes, I found the parents both believable.Yes, heartbreaking...at times, frightening, frustrating, and in turn, simply loving. Certainly made me cry. That's not easy.Most of all, the overall message-- yes there's more than one, but this vital one stands out --is to strive to live your best life; try to persevere.True enough, we're all dealt the cards we're dealt, so play your hand the best you're able. Life can & will call on your ability to deal with obstacles.Sooner... like here...or, later.But hey maybe keep hot ,rich boyfriend around, he's a keeper!I thought overall this isn't a story to pass on, not with the garbage out there audience's rush out to see!!So go ahead, might surprise you too!",

The film-makers here raked through this footage in order to make a film of their own and in doing so, came to the conclusion that they had discovered evidence of Monk being subjected to racist treatment from the television host.I don't know if I am going to be in the minority here, but I have to say that I did not concur with the film-makers findings in this one. To me, the host in question was not guilty of racism but of clunky questions. Sample example - 'why do you have a piano in your kitchen?' The only really contentious moment being when Monk is asked about his last time in France and he answers that he wasn't treated too well, with the host deciding that this was too negative an answer for his arts programme. It felt more like the host was wanting to keep things light for his telly show, as opposed to wanting to supress Monk because he was black. We also witness questions being repeated over and over but again, this seemed to have far less to do with lack of respect than us seeing the mechanics used to film TV shows, with re-takes etc being the tedious order of the day. So, there just didn't seem to be any real evidence of racism here and I felt that this was a case of film-makers reaching, in order to find controversy where little existed. This is additionally borne out by the fact that the doc lasts barely over an hour and yet huge chunks of that are allocated to uncontentious material such as behind the scenes stuff and Monk playing music. As a snapshot in time, this is kind of interesting but as an expose of racist behaviour, no it really isn't.",

It delves deep into a bizarre, abhorrent, yet fascinating world of polygamy, religious extremism, underage marriage, and molestation on a factory level. This swirling tale of both religious devotion and the exploitation of the respect and obedience of religious figures, I never once lost interest, and was even trying to do some paperwork, but couldn't because it was so damn eye-catching, I found myself fascinated by what would cause a man to do such evil things on a community level.The film doesn't just follow the trial of the convicted \"prophet\", it follows the community in which the fundamentalist group rules. A world full of strict rules, paranoia, police working under the eye of religious figure, and a world truly stuck in time. The film also follows the admittedly interesting history of the community and what lead the child molester in question to do what he did. The film is unflinching look at the most depraved of human behavior, child brides, child molestation, brain washing, and much more. This so called prophet created this world and the films sets out to expose him and the unjust behavior of certain individuals.I highly recommend it, but beware, its a tough subject.",

Sure, \"The History of Metal and Horror\" didn't exactly dish out things that I didn't already know, but there were some really nice appearances by icons from both the metal scene and the horror movie scene. And they were giving good interviews.The documentary is also laced with imagery from various horror movies and music performances, which definitely added a nice layer to the overall presentation of the documentary.If you are a fan of horror films and metal music, then I definitely recommend you sit down and watch \"The History of Metal and Horror\".My rating of \"The History of Metal and Horror\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",

This is about timeless music dating back to the birth of R&B but played and captured with 21st century film and editing tools & techniques.This is Scorsese-level filmmaking as far as I'm concerned - about an historic Woodstock-like musical collective - and it being successfully recreated in the present.It so wonderfully conveys bandleader Leon - and how he loves chaos and the unknown - which is sure speakin my language, and boy he'd fit right in with the Merry Pranksters.Unlike some movies where I'm clock-watching for it to be over - I didn't want this to ever end.

Ignore the handful of reviewers who claim it's \"Serb propaganda\" - that's just idiotic - in fact this is one of the best produced and written documentaries I've seen on contemporary geopolitical monkey-business to date! The interview snatches are all from erudite commentators, the chronology is unravelled in a comprehensive manner and footage they've amassed really adds a human quality to things. The footage of elderly Serb and Croat neighbours being forced to pack-up and leave after living together without and issue is heart-wrenching (and definitely not staged before someone suggests this).Also - by peeling away the propaganda the Serbs have been framed with for so long - we finally begin to hear the real ramifications of the war... which was partially a CORPORATE war. Bosnitch adds some amazing facts - such as the Yugo car industry being terminated by clever bombing - and the take-over by US firm Philip Morris by Clinton agreeing to bomb three times a very successful Serb cigarette factory - so much for military targets??!

Brandi Carlile, a gifted musician in her own right, opens the film with her initial efforts to contact Tanya and convince her to produce a new country album. Most of the film focusses on her working with a somewhat hesitant Tanya on the new album with occasional glimpses back into Tanya's budding career when she started singing at venues like country fairs in her early teens.While the bulk of the film focusses on the production of a new country album, it does go on to include the effort required to bring Tanya back for a live performance and without giving away any spoilers, the national recognition achieved for Brandi and Tanya's effort.While the film does hint at the reasons for Tanya's 15 year hiatus from the country music scene, I feel the one criticism would be that it didn't explore that aspect of her life very much leaving viewers to possibly question the circumstances that led to her dropping out of the music scene.Overall, I think it is a worthwhile & interesting watch to learn more about another music legend who came from such a poor background and became wildly successful at such an early age.",

He blends a series of questions into a mix of academic, pop culture, and humorous approach to the subject on hand. Khan does rise up to the occasion as he is able to follow a man who gets an implant, one that is well endowed, and he pros and cons of circumcision. It also delves into the iconography throughout the ages and makes for one interesting documentary. The Dickumentary is an adventure to the core of the male identity. I viewed this movie as part of the 2015 Atlanta Film Festival.",

The filmmakers have made this into an interesting story by adding many real-life elements - family, childhood, love life - into the calendar structure dictated by his recovery, physical therapy and training. It works. Chiesa comes across as a genuine, kind and outgoing family guy with some vulnerabilities and fears related to his injury. The film is a pleasure to watch because the location of each scene is announced with beautiful shots of the places, and many nice shots of the Alps and the Apennines. It's also a great insight into the arduous, detailed and scientific way that elite athletes are brought back from injury.",

Lina decides to help him and in so doing confront the most painful parts of her past so as not to repeat them in the future.\"Emotion in a man is weakness. You must have control, an iron fist. Keep your children in check. I worked four jobs and put food on the table. What did I do wrong? You don't listen. I barely touched you. Use your head. Don't talk back.\"\"To escape the violence I had to look inside myself. If I was not perfect, I was beaten. I felt worthless, shame. He is obsessed. Arguments are endless. It's always my fault. He plays the victim. Love doesn't hurt.\"While watching Tata and for a long while afterwards I couldn't drop my preconceived notions of what the film should be about and just let the filmmaker tell her story. I'm happy she finally won this battle in my head. Now, after thinking about the film, I better realize her intentions and meaning. She let her dad speak his mind and play his hand, without judgment, interference, or lack of support. What true journalistic and healing spirit Lina reveals in this documentary. The directors are partners and parents in real life. They attended and answered questions at this world premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival.",

Could it bring out the artist and the superstar? YES! It does.In contrast to the documentary film George Michael himself worked on until his death (Freedom), Simon Napier-Bell takes a more thorough approach. Because here he ensures that we go through George's career and life chronologically. In terms of music and career, this will be a reminder of how insanely big a pop star George Michael became. And the reunion with the big hits makes the documentary worth watching (for that reason alone). This documentary shows and also gives new insight into the star's private life. There were great challenges and a great deal of hardship. Documentary maker Napier-Bell manages well to bring out how Michael used music to honestly share his personal challenges through music.We will never get George Michael back. He was unique, and this film clearly shows how great he was, both as a man and as an artist. But in the same way as documentaries made about e.g. Whitney Houston and Prince, this documentary in all its horror also shows the great personal stresses of being in the limelight all the time. George Michael didn't make it easy for himself in that respect, but he was always honest and stood his ground.Carels' Whisper and many other songs will ensure that we will remember him primarily for the music. This documentary will also ensure that new generations become better acquainted with the superstar George Michael.",

            "storyline": "\"The Human Factor\"There was a time when peace appeared to be just within reach. What went so horribly wrong? The film revisits three decades of an 'Israeli-Arab' peace process from a unique perspective; that of 'The American' mediators, the peacemakers who shuttled between 'Middle East' capitals, spending hours with the region's political heavyweights, prime ministers, generals, ex-terrorists, diplomats, dictators and presidents. These mediators gained intimate knowledge of the individuals and stories which dominated daily news around the world. For all those key figures, some working on the same issue for almost three decades, peace in 'The Middle East' became a personal obsession, a mission which shaped their professional careers, affected their personal lives, and still occupies their minds. The negotiators speak candidly about their experiences alongside never-before-seen, official 'White House' photography that illustrates what really went on behind the scenes in rooms away from photo opportunities. Rich and exposing portraits of world leaders are portrayed as we learn what really went on behind closed doors in meetings between 'U. S.' presidents, 'Israeli', 'Palestinian', and 'Syrian' leaders.What we observe, for the first time, are first-hand impressions of events that shook the world, not from the perspectives of the conflicting parties involved, or that of politicians who care about their legacy, but from senior civil servants, the negotiators. It's their function to observe, relate, maintain neutrality, and convince both sides of the pressing necessity to resolve decades of brutal violence and turmoil. With the distance of time behind them, the negotiators forensically dissect and examine, now from a critical perspective, their own role as 'Americans' in the process. Some of the most burning questions into these crucial issues are answered with remarkable candor and self-reflection. There's no other conflict in the world where the price of the diplomatic failure was so clearly evident. Today, in the complete absence of any 'Israeli-Palestinian' peace negotiations and the very notion of diplomacy on the wane, the stakes couldn't be higher and the need to learn from past mistakes couldn't be more urgent. \"The Human Factor\" is the untold, behind-the-scenes story of 'The United States' 30-year effort to secure peace in 'The Middle East', told from the perspective of 'The American' negotiators.Ultimately, \"The Human Factor\" is a tragic story, one in which we see 'American' determination and idealism hit an iron wall of deeply entrenched enmities and historical mistrust. Despite their tireless efforts at the pinnacle of international diplomacy, theirs is a story of very human failure filled with disappointment and regret. Even unprecedented 'American' presidential commitment and tireless efforts that produce incremental breakthroughs prove insufficient to produce 'The Middle East' peace they see within their grasp. \"The Human Factor\" provides us insights and revelations gleaned along this journey and reveals a painful story of hope, idealism, determination, and a historic 'Middle East' moment that may never be replicated. In capturing this unique, fleeting moment encompassing the last decade of 'The 20th Century', the film presents a brutally honest, self-critical, first-person account of the challenges, surprises, and herculean obstacles these peacemakers faced as they tried to help create a new, peaceful 'Middle East'. On November 4th, 1995, Prime Minister Rabin was shot. 25 years of work trying to achieve peace between 'Israel' and it's 'Arab' neighbors, not what happened in front of the camera but behind the scenes, with the leaders and the other 'American' negotiators. This is a story with global impact. We feel a deep desire to really understand why although a huge 'American' effort had been invested into the peace process, all attempts to reach peace went so badly wrong since that horrible November night.For more than thirty years, no issue mattered more than trying to make peace between 'Israel' and it's neighbors. This is not simply an exercise in negotiations between parties in an ongoing conflict. In historic conflicts where the collective mentality is zero-sum and each side's mythologies are deeply embedded, compromise with the other is politically and emotionally excruciating. Setbacks are, thus, far more common than advances, and the mediator has to believe enough in the importance of settling the conflict to endure all the disappointments. Anyone who thinks that the current breakthroughs between 'The UAE,' 'Bahrain' and 'Israel' would have happened without 'The Oslo' process misunderstands the region. If 'Palestinians' can deal with 'Israelis', given their existential conflict, it's okay for others to do so as well. Of course, the emergence of common threat perceptions of 'Iran' and 'The Muslim Brotherhood' accelerated this process. And, now, ironically, the message is that 'The Palestinians' cannot freeze the region and prevent individual 'Arab' states from pursuing their own national interests. 'Palestinians' need to adjust their thinking and see how growing 'Arab' ties to 'Israel' can be a bridge for them and not a bypass road for excluding them. 'Israelis', too, must see these ties as not only good in themselves, but also do provide a bridge for breaking the stalemate with 'The Palestinians'. At the end of the day, 'The Palestinians' are not going away. Neither are 'The Israelis', and the human factor in negotiations and between societies must come to the fore. Revisiting history can bring back disappointment and aspirations. We hope that future generations can learn that seizing opportunities is the main responsibility of leaders and nations.Looking back now over more than two decades of involvement in 'US' efforts in 'Israeli- Palestinian' peacemaking, we haven't given up hope that at some point a conflict-ending solution might be found; but we've given up our illusions. What's required more than anything else, leaders on both sides who are masters not prisoners of their political constituencies and ideologies willing to recognize the needs of the other, is rarely present. It's no coincidence that the three breakthroughs in 'The Arab-Israeli' conflict; 'Israel-Egypt'; 'Israel-Palestinians'; 'Israel-Jordan', occurred secretly without the foreknowledge of 'The United States'. Once the parties crossed that threshold and are invested in their negotiations, then and only then is 'America' able to play a useful role; and even then far too often, especially in 'Israeli-Palestinian' negotiations, we favored 'Israeli' positions over those of The Palestinians' who at any rate hewed to a narrative that 'Israel' wouldn't accept. Indeed when we failed it's almost always a result of looking at the world the way we want it to be rather than the way it actually is. We've to be more honest with ourselves we might have realized that the gaps that separated 'Israelis' and 'Palestinians' are simply too large to be bridged. And that however well-intentioned our efforts, 'The US' couldn't replace the lack of political will on their part with our own. Under these conditions, the idea that failure is not an option resulted in an outcome where failure is the only option.But there should have been no purpose, and there has been considerable harm, in adding to their real mistakes a list of fictional ones. 'The Israeli' side bears significant responsibility for failure too. It's offer is far below what any 'Palestinian' leader could accept, and it's all-or-nothing approach inevitably led to a predictable result; nothing. Likewise, blame must fall on 'The American' side, which too often acted as a messenger of warmed up 'Israeli' ideas, rather than as originator of viable ones. The orthodoxy born of 'Camp David' has larger, immeasurably harmful effects, some of which we're living with to this day. Broader conclusions, that 'Israel' has no peace partner, and that 'Palestinians' are incapable of compromise; took hold. It's no coincidence that hope for a fair, two-state solution has faded, giving way to a one-state reality of inequality, injustice, and despair.Written by Gregory Mann.",

The film does a very thorough job of illustrating the various - erm - unique facets of the company's oeuvre, with plenty of clips that may shock even seasoned viewers. It also manages to make a fairly convincing case about the value and importance of pornography as a means for the gay community to speak about and to itself, and the importance of preserving this history.I wish the film had done a better job actually portraying the two gentlemen behind the company, however - we just get a tiny bit of background about both of them, and, despite being the co-protagonists, neither emerges as a terribly well-developed character. I guess the star of the film is ultimately the videos, but, even at just 79 minutes, things start to drag toward the end, feeling like the film's treading the same territory. Result is a fairly satisfying portrait of an obscure part of smut film history, but would have better staying power if it had taken a bit more time with the surrounding details.",

In this documentary you stay glued and continue to listen, engaged and involved, and sometimes it's as if you maintain eye contact with each person. The stories were so personal you felt as though you were standing in the room with them, feeling their pain, sorrow or anguish; and if you had been, you'd surely have given them a hug or a kind word. The stories were sad, but the impression of people bonding together for the greater good is evident - that people pooled together to help one another.A bittersweet documentary which grabs your heart and makes you realise the ease and swiftness with which life can change, but also makes you smile at the strength and beautiful memories which each individual held for their dear loved ones.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. Over the years, I've managed to maintain zero artistic ability, and yet my admiration and respect for artists has continued to grow. It's quite likely you've never heard of Geoff McFetridge, and equally likely that no one you know has either. Leave it to commercial director and artist Dan Covert to recognize that a fellow artist's story is worth telling.With interviews from film directors Spike Jonze (also an Executive Producer) and Sofia Coppola, and photographer Andrew Paynter, we get a real sense for the admiration McFetridge draws from other artists. His wife Sarah also gives us her perspective on her husband as an artist, father, and partner, and yet we find Geoff's own introspection to be the most descriptive and informative. This is a man who doesn't shy away from self-analysis ... which makes sense given his personal mission.For an artist as prolific as McFetridge, it's not surprising to learn that his childhood habit of \"drawing all the time\" has followed him into adulthood. It's really more of an obsession than a habit, and he's managed to turn it into a profession. Born in Canada, he made the decision to enroll at the California Institute of Arts, and now can be described as melding art with commerce. His work has adorned ads and products for such companies as Nike, Apple, and Pepsi (among many others).Surprisingly, it's not his brilliant design work that is most interesting. Rather it's Geoff's constant pursuit of meaning in everything he does - in art, while running ultra-marathons, and in being a husband and father to two daughters. This is a man who pushes himself constantly. Down time is not part of his plan. He used art as a way out and way to have control as he searched for his place. He always had the colors and form (geometry on acid), and his wife Sarah is the one who instilled emotion into his work.McFetridge is highly respected by other graphic artists, while remaining virtually unknown to the general public. His greatest gift is not a steady hand, but rather an innovate mind tied to a tireless work ethic. It seems strange to say, but he's inspirational in the way he seeks meaning - giving us the desire as well. On the surface, one would expect a biopic on an under-the-radar graphic artist to be a short film, but director Covert understood that a full 80 minutes would better serve the audience. He was right.In NYC theaters on June 21, 2024 and VOD via Gravitas beginning July 2, 2024.",

Is there a cyber war, is not the question, but who is winning it. If the experts in Kill Chain are to be trusted, then America, and other nations, are pretending that the war isn't even happening.As documentaries go, many are made with partisan funding and motivations, and released during election campaigns with uncanny timing. Kill Chain manages to portray a bi-partisan issue with voices from more than one administration and both sides of the aisle, even if it directly attacks key Republicans. The message is clear, but therin lies some of its faults.Harri Hursti is the focal point of the documentary, travelling around the world to speak with experts that unanimously pontificate the vulnerabilities of digital voting that lacks a paper trail of accountability for audit. He is accomplished, knowledgable and believable as an expert in the field of cyberwarfare. Assertions are made that the exploitation is a possibility, but little discussion takes place around if they are being exploited - it is assumed that they are. That sets the bar rather low when all that is required is to cast doubt. This criticism, however, is not without merit and that is where Kill Chain becomes compelling in its message.Numerous examples are provided of how the exploits can happen, and direct comments in defence of the American systems are addressed and effectively disproved with great ease. Election machines, for example, are demonstrated to be easily obtained and brought to a hackers convention that demonstrates some of the most disconcerting patterns of issues. It becomes a lost opportunity in light of the amassed circumstances that none of the official authorities or manufacturers would participate. Their silence, in this case, is deafening.",

This documentary focuses more on the wineries, traditions, the lands and various processes. While there are many alluring tours of famous winery's vast and old cellar collections (never has moldy bottles looked so appetizing) and tons of eloquent wine descriptions and conversations, there was also a bad ass scene of a man opening a rare bottle of wine with a large sword and gracefully and properly pouring it into an awaiting wine glass after he told you why this vintage is so good and how excited he was to taste it. It did try to teach you why certain wine cost so much and why they are worth it....for those with an educated pallet. But it also didn't turn its nose up at the under $10 bottles either and it did show how those wines are produced differently. Pretty big difference. I felt more educated after and it was very enjoyable and picturesque. Solid and effective documentary.",

It paints a clear picture of industry and government working hand-in-hand over decades, often in incredibly deceitful ways by promising to protect public lands only to turn around and break those promises for the special interests that finance their campaigns.Despite its strong storytelling, and narratives of indigenous peoples standing up to massive industries in order to protect their livelihoods and beautiful ecosystems, there is one glaring oversight in this film: cattle. The film briefly mentions cattle grazing on it's list of industries who have been eying and gobbling up our land space, but if fails miserably to call cattle grazing out for the destructive force it has become, particularly in arid western states like Utah. The Center for Biological Diversity states that \"(t)he ecological costs of livestock grazing exceed that of any other western land use,\" including \"the most widespread cause of species endangerments.\"In fact, the film goes out of it's way to paint ranchers as the victims and as stewards of land protection, when in fact that couldn't be further from the truth. It's not surprising, given that Patagonia is a major proponent of Regenerative Agriculture, including grazing, and I guess somehow feels that if they acknowledge the problems of cattle grazing they are undermining their own mission. And no doubt ranchers and hunters make up a sizable portion of their consumer base.Of course they are a some ranchers who are doing things more \"sustainably\" and truly do value the land and ecosystems they work in. But the fact is that raising cattle is inherently damaging to ecosystems and hugely resource intensive, especially for the vast majority of land where cattle graze (and over graze) on our public lands for pennies on the dollar.",

He spoke about it to his Academy Award nominated filmmaker and friend Sturla Gunnarson. It took Sturla by surprise. He was reticent. So Lazlo introduced Sturla to David. Alea jacta est! The deal was sealed. The movie would be made with the collaboration of the NFB, CBC and E1.As the movie opens, the 75 year old David Suzuki, looking like a sprightly middle-aged man, delivers his legacy speech in front of a sold-out, enrapt Vancouver audience.

It's supposed to be interviewing prostitutes but the end credits list most of the women's names and they're successful Japanese AV (Porn) actresses from both before & after this film. One has done softcore movies. Second, each segment is a different girl who is narrating some very profound dialogue that doesn't actually say anything. One quote while the girl is crawling around naked on the ground full of leaves says \"You, do you lose your equilibrium in painful solitude to a point of no return?\" Gimme a break! It's obvious none of the women wrote their own narration. My favorite quote in this film is \"A fly buzzes in my uterus!\" I'm not making this up. Anyone that believes this was a real documentary is an idiot.Every scene is filmed in a dark room or area with only the subjects barely lit, presumably with a flashlight. Even two scenes that take place in a nightclub are dark rooms with only the women barely lit. In one case there is an audience of about 15 men seen very briefly in reflected light only, all dressed identical.Some scenes contain hardcore sex or explicit nudity tho briefly. The hardcore sex scene stops being shown very quickly (no complete hardcore like an actual porn) and cuts to a distant view or just the woman's face. Some scenes are just walking or laying around by themselves. A couple of times you see someone injecting a needle. This is I think supposed to be drugs but if you look at the syringes, it's obviously empty. Again, fake. One scene is a man (I think because it's so poorly lit & from a side view) masturbating. All scenes as I said are so poorly lit you can barely make anything out. Each woman begins her narration by saying she \"was given her name as Iku but her real name is\" then gives a presumably real name. Is there a point to that? All the audio including the moaning seems to be added in post. Even some sex scenes have edits & cuts but the audio is continuous.They are not prostitutes in this movie. The women didn't write their own dialogue/narration. This film doesn't seem to have a point or any redeeming value. I gave it one star but it should be zero.",

The documentary then goes back to the early days when the league was started in 1996. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary directed by Dawn Porter (\"John Lewis: Good Trouble\"). It is co-produced by several WNBA players, including Sue Bird. Here Porter looks back at the tumultuous year that was 2020, when the world as we knew stopped (due to COVID 19) and the police brutality on Blacks reached levels unimaginable, while at the same time a presidential and congressional elections were unfolding also in ways unimaginable. In the midst of it all, the players of the WNBA decide to use their platform to tell the world what they thought of it all. The most interesting aspect of it all is the Kelly Loeffler, majority owner of the Atlanta Dream and gifted a seat in the US Senate, decides to go all in on Trump and MAGA, to fight off the upstart campaign for that all-important US Senate seat by Rafael Warnock, a Black pastor. Let's just say this right here and now: \"Power Of the Dream\" is NOT a sports documentary. It is a political documentary about how WNBA players (of which most of them are Black) use their platform to broadcast their political views. As such this makes for a powerful documentary. It also is a stark reminder why insanely shocking the year 2020 turned out to be in so many ways.\"Power of the Dream\" premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim. It started streaming on Amazon Prime a few weeks ago. The documentary is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels a bit too generous to me. That said, if you are in the mood for a political documentary about the tumultuous year that was 2020, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

The contributors are tastefully chosen and, although initially a bit strange, the decision to use Carl Lumbly to make Davis's own raspy words and blunt musings the \"throughline\" is a really smart one. It'd be nice to see more artist documentaries build themselves around the actual thoughts of the person. Beyond this, the documentary sadly struggles to walk the line between art and artist, and we get a couple of clunky omissions that feel a little onerous. To skip over his influential electric period almost entirely is a serious shame.",

A paper trail of suppressed scientific research, and buried documents reveals why ticks, and the diseases they carry, have been allowed to quietly spread around the globe.Unable to walk due to Lyme disease, 12-year-old Julia Bruzzese is blessed by Pope Francis on live television, thrusting both her and Lyme into the public eye. This attracts the attention of public health officials who warn Julia's father, Enrico, against pursuing treatment for Lyme disease. Aware of the Lyme disease controversy, they ignore the warnings and venture into the fringes of medicine. Five years into treatment and still sick, Julia and her family begin advocating for others. Neil Spector, a Duke University cancer researcher, receives a heart transplant due to Lyme. He realizes Lyme testing and treatment has been at a standstill for decades and shifts his focus to tick-borne disease. Neil's lab makes a discovery that may revolutionize the field, and he falls ill with a virus. Due to his weakened immune system, Neil passes away at the age of 63. Julia is not fully cured under Neil Spencer's care, her quality of life significantly improves.We've come to know Lyme as a deeply complex illness that has yet to be fully understood. According to the CDC, an estimated 500,000 people are infected with Lyme each year, and 10-20% of them remain sick after antibiotic treatment. Even still, Lyme is often dismissed by the medical establishment. We hope our film can be the catalyst needed to awaken the public to this threat and re-engage the medical and scientific communities on finding answers for a disease that is as close as our own backyard. Lyme + Long-COVID, the mystery of Chronic Lyme mirrors the issues we're facing with long-COVID. Many of the same questions exist. Is long COVID due to a lingering virus, or is it an auto-immune issue caused by damage, long after the virus is gone? In the case of COVID, patients with long haul symptoms are being taken seriously, a privilege never granted to those with Lyme.They insist Lyme is not chronic and downplay the severity of in utero transmission. A growing body of scientific research challenges their claims, and their technologies. The goal is to elevate this evidence and new science. Those at risk deserve to know, Lyme is far more complex than we know. We believe profit-motives have stunted our understanding of chronic illness, making it incredibly difficult for doctors like him to practice medicine with proper support from insurance companies and medical boards.Written by Gregory Mann.",

As a non-Mongolian that married into a Mongolian family, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the culture and a bit of history knowledge, but Robert does a wonderful job explaining some of the key aspects of Mongolia's history. There seems to be more focus in the 1921 - 2022 period which experienced a dramatic change in culture, politics, and Westernization while maintaining its core heritage as proud Mongolians.What isn't shown in the movie, but deserves a boat load of recognition is how DIFFICULT it is to make this movie... as someone who has also traveled extensively in the Mongolian countryside, there is a ton of rough off-roading involved, little cell reception, insane weather (can go down to -40 c or -40 F in winter), heavy population in the city during the winter (exceeding 999 AQI), difficult sleeping accommodations (compared to Western standards) and a meat-heavy diet when leaving Ulaanbaatar. Kudos to Robert and the film crew for their endurance and thanks to all the amazing Mongolian people that contributed to this documentary. It's perhaps the finest documentary made about Mongolian in the last 100 years.",

This film is an important vehicle by which we can further educate policy-makers and the general public about the value of entering into and maintaining recovery. The film's Director, Greg Williams, is extremely knowledgeable and respectful of 12-Step principals.

An example of where industry plans, to safely store nuclear waste, have been exposed as flawed is the proposed dump site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, US. After nearly 20 years of research and billions of dollars of investment, not one gram of spent fuel has been shipped to the site from nuclear reactors across the US. Major uncertainties in the geological suitability for waste disposal at the site remain. In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.",

A lot of people giving the talking points that everyone on the planet knows about addiction... over and over and over. Also a lot of strange shots of anonymous people doing alcohol and/or drugs... also over and over and over. I gave it one extra star for the interview with Amy's father and the short clip of Amy's last concert in Serbia. Neither were great, but they were only things that were at all interesting or fresh. They probably seemed even better than they were given that I was nearly comatose by the time they were presented.",

This week momma grizzly #399, at the age of 28 and after birthing 18 cubs, was hit and killed by a vehicle near Jackson Hole. At this time she had one cub about 18 months old, they are looking for it. I suspect the conservationists will evaluate the situation and do what is best for them.R. I.

Yet those diets are what we either consume or are told to consume. I wish the documentary would have explained in more detail that they recommend removing grains and sugars but replacing them with healthy fats. I thought the Primal Diet was about eating more protein but they seam to say that we should replace the sugar and grain calories with more fats including animal fats for optimal health. But otherwise, fast paced for a documentary, well presented information that should be eye-opening to all.",

In fact I have rated thousands of films on IMDb, and New York Doll happens to be 1 of only 15 films I have given a full 10 rating. First off, this documentary is done the way a documentary is suppose to be done. It is completely observatory. It does not try to make you believe something, or sway your opinion this way or that way. It has a refreshing integrity throughout. After watching NY Doll, I couldn't help but feel that this film in itself seems like such a fateful occurrence. An independent amateur filmmaker happens to stumble into the well aged Arthur 'Killer' Kane, former member of the raucous and raunchy 1970's glam/punk rock act, the New York Dolls. He finds that Arthur misses the days of rock n' roll fame and mischief, but now has a totally new and simple life in which he has found some sort of solace in a new faith in God. What follows upon their collaboration is hard to express fully in words. It must be seen, but it seems as though the filmmaker and the subject met each other at the perfect time. Arthur's journey here in is one so honest, so human, that I found it almost impossible to not get emotionally choked up over, even after repeat viewings; And it is a rare event when I get choked up over a film. This is an absolute must see if you like human stories. If you like movies or documentaries at all, it's a must see. It doesn't matter if you don't believe in God, or even if you don't know who the hell the New York Dolls are. It doesn't even matter if you like rock music. See the film, thank me later.If I'm acting like a king / Well that's cause, I'm a Human Being / And If I want too many things / Don't you know that, I'm a Human Being / And if I've got to dream / Baby baby yeah, I'm a Human Being10/10",

But it is lacking more explanation, and mentions of some historic authorities on fasting like my favorites Herbert M Shelton, Ross Horne, Graham, J.H.Tilden etc. I think the story should have started from them and it should start from history anyways. There is lack of explanation that fasting is only there to remove cause and without proper changes in diet it is useless, the theory which is completely explained by my favorite historic doctors. But good try, part of it is good, proven, explained, finished. This movie is best suited for those who believe in way to health through diet, fasting, lifestyle changes, as opposed to those who only believe in magic pills, surgeries, or doing or taking something. It teaches us that sometimes it is best to do nothing or stop doing something to get health we wanted. Also good way how Russian and other knowledge is translated and explained to western population (USA, Europe, Canada).",

Having serious personal issues is one thing, but not taming them and then going so far as to write such a pretentious review, wreaking of self-importance and instability like this one, is another thing. I guess I write this as I sometimes tire of fully grown 'normal' people, so clearly suffering from issues they choose to ignore, and who confuse their need to expiate personal venom with a 'review'. It sounds grotesque, and helps no one to understand anything about the film - more about the author's instabilities. In passing, I congratulate the filmmakers on a well made and touching near-zero budget film. We'd be so much poorer if we didn't have such people making these films.",

That he probably doesn't even paint anymore, or that he paints too much...And then I saw people from all walks of life overcome with joy upon receiving one of his artworks.What makes this artist so polarising?I spent four years getting to know the Bromley's world by photographing various projects, and in the process I developed a close friendship with David and Yuge. We shared many late nights that would often end up in moving conversations about life's hardships, and also life's beauty. This is where I learnt how powerful and unique David's story is, and that it cannot be told through still images alone. David is an uncontrollable creative wrecking ball, and I knew that a film, rooted in observational documentary would be the best way to show this.The uniqueness of this story lies within David's past. How do you turn your life around when all you feel is darkness? The conversation around mental health is taking place more frequently today, though stigma still surrounds sufferers. This story offers a deep insight into David's inner life and his road to overcoming these challenges.As David himself says, \"art saved my life\". But that's just the beginning of this story. David upends the art world's limitations on what an artist should be, and its perception of commercial success.My vision for this film is for it to be a relentless exploration of life. A story of a lost soul being found again, a story of overcoming an intense darkness to not only find beauty in the world but beauty within oneself too.There will never be another David Bromley, a unique Australian treasure that audiences are bound to fall in love with and be inspired by. An artist who demonstrates why we shouldn't fear obsession, and how finding beauty is his life's work . Most importantly BROMLEY is a story of love prevailing over darkness.''",

I was glad I did.Filmed over a number of years this is a solid, sometimes poetic, very sad film about the building of a garbage dump in the picturesque sea-side Turkish town of Camburnu, and how it slowly destroyed the town and its way of life. Eco horror stories like this are nothing new, but Akin's humanist approach makes us care by letting us get to know and like some of the crucial people of the town – like the mayor – who are fighting an endless uphill battle against the damage the lying and disinterested central government is wreaking on them. These people are no rural rubes – they seem to know more about the law and even the engineering flaws of the dump's construction than the pathetic men who are supposed to be in charge. Inspiring at times, depressing and defeating at others, it's not the first film to show how greed and indifference is undermining our world, but it's a strong and human example.",

As in other parts of their empire, the Nazis embarked on a systematic campaign to ostracize Jews, and subsequently send them to concentration camps back in Germany. They tried to do this with Turkish Jews, but were prevented from doing so by the intervention of local Turkish diplomats, who put their own lives at risk by insisting that, as members of a neutral country, Turks had to be left alone. The diplomats worked hard to save members of the Franco-Turkish families, issuing passports and teaching them a few words of Turkish so that they could pass as Turks. Eventually they organized a series of rescue trains to transport the Turks out of France to the safety of Istanbul. Using first-hand testimony from those involved (both French and Turkish nationals) plus re-enacted scenes, Turkish PASSPORT tells a tale of heroism and endurance that leaves us feeling uplifted, in spite of the horrors of Nazi rule.",

Or how she bailed out of a second marriage when haunted by the images of her frustrated musical grandmothers. Or how giving away her daughter is a stain on her image and a personal trauma, while many male artists have abandoned their children with much more ease.They could have left in at least one whole song, like Little Green, or one whole performance on stage so as to show, not tell, what a great composer and performer she was.Mostly one wonders what the point is of reducing such a career to one hour.

This transforms most of the local Florida characters from wobbly old men into little boys, and most look like they've never seen the inside of a golf course except one to pass out on that they've trespassed across. Unlike the below-zero-budget documentary \"First Call\", there's only a few female companions onscreen. One of the funniest attempts at avant grade technique is the film-maker's insistence on shooting extreme close-ups of his subjects, some lasting for 15 seconds, saying nothing. This wierdo collection of live mug-shots almost functions as its own artistic sobriety test.",

            "storyline": "According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, twenty two veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars commit suicide every day, more than die in combat itself. Many more suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are compelled to take prescription drugs simply to be able to function. Professor Richard Davidson at The Center for Investigating Healthy Minds in Madison, Wisconsin is looking for a different and more effective way of treatment. Danish director Phie Ambo, in her film Free the Mind, has documented a seven-day study directed by Davidson to see if the brain can be \"rewired\" to achieve stabilizing results that drugs have been unable to.The study used techniques popular in Eastern cultures such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, mindfulness, yoga, and other alternative methods and their report suggests that the program, even after one week, shows promise. (If meditation techniques were indeed found to work better than pills in this situation, my guess is that it would be quickly marginalized by the media acting on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry). Professor Davidson has been meditating for thirty years, much to the chagrin of his colleagues, and states that a conversation he had with the Dalai Lama in 1992 put him on a path to attempt to counter depression and suicide by developing an individual's capacity for compassion and kindness.He says that, \"We actually have no idea of how conscious experience arises from this blob of matter that weighs three pounds. It's really still very much a mystery.\" The film focuses on married veterans Steve and Rich who have come home from the front with self-destructive feelings of guilt about their participation in the war and witnessing the death of fellow combatants that they had become close to. For Rich, the leader of a battalion, his trauma has taken the form of anxiety attacks and an inability to communicate his feelings, even to those closest to him. Both suffer from insomnia and irritability and have lost touch with their childhood innocence and the love they once felt for life.Rich has ended his marriage and is seeking a divorce while Steve's marriage is in jeopardy because of his inability to control his anger. Also participating in the study is five-year-old Will who has been diagnosed with ADHD and is attending a preschool for children, many of whom have similar emotional problems. As a result of his once being trapped in an elevator by himself, Will has a deep-seated fear of elevators and is working with meditation teacher Laura Pinger to use mindfulness techniques to deal with these fears and other social behavior issues.Unfortunately, after a dispute with another boy who ended up in tears, the meditation teacher failed to seize the opportunity to teach the children about sharing or coming up with their own solution to the problem, rather concentrating on a learned script about locating their emotions in the body. Free the Mind comes from the ground of being that the brain is a mechanistic object and Ms. Ambo feels the need to use snazzy visual displays including flashing cable lights to simulate what is happening in the brain, and intrusive Twilight Zone-type music to make sure that we know that something \"mysterious\" is going on.While we can only applaud seeking methods to lessen the dependence on prescription drugs, especially its use on children as young as three, it seems to me that the substituting of one technique for another does not fully address the problem. In my view, it should be part of a broader holistic approach that may include a combination of drugs as well as meditation and breathing exercises, yoga, and large group interaction that can encourage the participants to see that they are not alone and can reach out to others, and to be in touch with a larger spiritual experience of themselves and others. After all, in its essence, meditation is not a scientific tool but a spiritual practice that allows us to expand our awareness and access a deeper reality.",

            "storyline": "This film struggles with some fascinating archival footage and trying to stretch both the length and message of the film too broadly around that.This country struggles with civil rights sadly over and over again, now to the point where the one thing uniting far too many citizens is an unwavering distrust of the government. Documenting protests is important in understanding both the strength and vulnerability of the not-always-so-United States. That said I feel like any assembly of mobs...protesters (also I guess anti-protesters generally few but vociferous) and then the police force can bring out the mob mentality on both sides.In general color me wary of both, but especially the ones where everyone in the mob has a gun.Anyways this film might best be served by watching the trailer or a sped-up or excerpted version of it. I assume the abridged version won't have the slow zoom and defocus on pixelated faces. Although that would do a disservice to DJ Rupture's excellent soundtrack work.Looking forward...\n1) Well I do think for all of the struggles, the arc or the USA does bend towards a better country...often painfully and painfully slowly.2) The notion of test cities for police exercises is still going on afaik, didn't the former Blackwater corporation utilize them recently before they re-branded or whatever?3) Sierra Pettengill might be an excellent resource for gathering archival footage for other directors' projects. I see she was part of the team for the Jarmusch documentary on the The Stooges (with Iggy that is, not Curly).I struggle to recommend this, but with expectations lowered for less of an expose and more of an art collage meditation with occasional Gulf advertisements - it might be worth an hour of your time, although the running time is 1.5 hours.",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have scoffed at the \"Madea\" movies, or the periodic screen appearances of Tyler Perry in supporting roles, this documentary from Gelila Bekele (she and Perry share a child) and Armani Ortiz will open your eyes to the money-making machine and unstoppable force that is Tyler Perry. Clearly more of a tribute to his accomplishments than a deep dive into the man, his business, and his life, the film leaves us with full respect for what he has accomplished, as well as an understanding of an industry mogul who maintains complete control of his projects.The opening credits play like a four-minute trailer for the movie we are about to watch, and that's likely for the benefit of those who haven't been paying attention to Perry's ongoing success and his building of a media empire over the last two decades. Time is spent on his childhood in New Orleans, where sadly, he was so severely mistreated by his father that he later changed his name from Emmett Perry Jr to Tyler, in order to create the emotional distance he needed.His close friend Oprah Winfrey states that Perry \"turned pain into power\", and most of the film details how he went from self-financing a small theater production to constructing the sprawling Tyler Perry Studios on a 330-acre site in Atlanta that was originally the Confederate Army base, Fort McPherson. In fact, the 2019 grand opening of the studios is used as a bit of defining structure throughout, although it times, bouncing back and forth gives a sense of redundancy.The studios are quite impressive, as is the fact that Perry accomplished this outside of the traditional Hollywood system. And other than the remarkable 'rags-to-riches' story, it's Perry's ability to blaze his own unconventional trail that garners the most respect. He recognized the underserved and underestimated Black audience and committed to providing material for \"his audience\". Beginning with his first movie, DIARY OF A MAD HOUSEWIFE (2005), Perry worked his plan. While the critics bashed, the film cashed. Lionsgate President Michael Paseornek took notice, and again, Perry bucked the system by demanding creative control, ownership of his work, and establishing new parameters for TV series and syndication.Perry's work ethic is dwelled upon here, as is his love for his mother Willie Maxine Perry, who shows up in some clips and photos. Cousin Lucky Johnson offers the most insightful personal observations of what Perry's traumatic childhood was like, lending credence to the remarkable success. Perry's determination is beyond reproach, as is his mental toughness and ability to stick to his focus on control and ownership. The music/score of the film is frequently intrusive and overbearing, often distracting from the story, and the film is probably 20 to 30 minutes longer than it should be. However, taking a love-fest approach makes sense in this case, as Tyler Perry has progressed from dreamer to achiever, and the lessons are crystal clear.Releases on Prime Video on November 17, 2023.",

            "storyline": "This is an insightful documentary which delves into the history and the cycle of poverty that entraps the Gadia Lohars who are named after bullock carts (Gadi) and their traditional occupation as blacksmiths (Lohar). The Gadias are one of the poorest communities in India and they have been excluded from official census records since the 1930s. Their way of life is reminiscent of their nomadic forefathers from centuries ago who were once highly respected craftsmen of fine armoury for Hindu kings but today they barely survive, facing impoverished living conditions despite their strenuous hard work and skills in iron work.The film investigates the reasons behind the shocking living conditions of the Gadias who have no toilets or running water whilst they live in tents and carts. The availability of mass-produced tools, the lack of access to education due to their travelling lifestyle as well as lack of awareness of its importance, the cultural prestige attached to having large families and lots of children, and the lack of priority by the authorities towards the Gadias have made the cycle of deprivation almost impossible to escape from.Despite the negative views of local villagers who warns of the criminal behaviour of the Gadias, throughout the film they are a peaceful and resilient community. This is a fascinating ethnographic film of a group of mostly forgotten people. Despite being less than an hour in length, it crams so much interesting facts whilst the visual scenes are colourful and cheerful, which like the booming economy of the rest of India, is in stark contrast to the poverty-stricken livelihood of this deprived community.",

Zeki begins his time as a teacher with extreme methods including shooting students with a paintball gun , he convinces students that they do not want to become drug dealers and dependent on welfare.

            "storyline": "I'm a big fan of the 'Exhibition on Screen' series of art films. Since 2012 it has given me the opportunity to visit many of the most important art exhibitions or collections of the great museums of the world without having to travel further than the hall of the cinematheque (which also has the role of an art cinema) in the city where I live. Many of these films were directed and/or produced by Phil Grabsky. The COVID-19 pandemic has led, among its many consequences, to the closing of art museums almost all over the world and the suspension or cancellation of exhibitions scheduled in 2020 and 2021. The joy of the return of museums and major exhibitions in our lives has been amplified by the resumption of the series 'Exhibition on Screen '. 'Hopper - An American Love Story' (2022) was, I believe, the first film in this series produced and released after the pandemic. For me, the joy was all the greater as the director is Grabsky and the film is dedicated to an American artist that I love, learn about and look for wherever I travel the world: Edward Hopper.The documentary coincided with a major exhibition dedicated to 'Edward Hopper's New York' which took place at the Whitney Museum of Art in Manhattan between October 2022 and March 2023. Unlike other episodes of the 'Exhibition on Screen' series, however, this documentary doesn't take us to halls of the exhibition, which is not mentioned at all before the final credits. The subject of the exhibition on the screen is this time the person and the work as a whole of the painter. 'Hopper - An American Love Story' is closer to a classic biographical documentary film, following in chronological order the main stages of the painter's life and creation, filming in the places where he lived and traveled, using as visual material (also) works which were not exhibited at the Whitney and that documentary material exhibits from the memorial museum in Nyack (the place of his birth and childhood) and archival materials, including his wife's personal diaries. I enjoyed the commentary, belonging - as always in the 'Exhibition on Screen' episodes - to some of the most reputable and relevant experts on the topic. I learned many new things about the artist's biography, especially details related to the periods spent in Paris. Although he was there (on and off) for quite some time in the years after 1905, Hopper led a rather ascetic life in the company and hosting of religious female friends of his mother, and had no contact with either bohemian life or artistic revolutions of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art that was happening at the other end of Paris in Montmartre (he lived in Montparnasse). Also new to me was an unhappy love story from the Parisian period, which seems to have influenced the rest of his romantic life. The connection with his wife, Josephine Nivison Hopper, also occupied the important place in the film, as she had in the painter's life and work. I visited the memorial house in Nyack, where there is no Hopper painting, but some of his wife's work is on display. My estimation is that she was an artist of no inferior talent to him. Perhaps - being a woman - she would not have been able to reach the same level of celebrity, but he also would not have become what he became as an artist without the dedication and sacrifice of Josephine, who practically abandoned her career to support him.The artistic commentaries on the various later phases of Hopper's work are solid without being very original. At just one moment we are invited to look from a new perspective at the famous loneliness of the characters in Hopper's paintings. Some comments about the artist's apparent political and social disengagement seemed a bit forced. Hopper was an artist who said what he had to say about the time he lived in through his mysterious work, which refused manifest art and explicit statements. His paintings, drawings and watercolors are an integral part of the image of 20th century America as it is imprinted in the collective historical and cultural memory. 'Exhibition on Screen' gives us yet another landmark documentary about a great artist.",

            "storyline": "Lee Harvey Oswald: 48 Hours to Die (2013) **** (out of 4) For the 50th Anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, The History Channel produced two new documentaries with this one here looking directly at the final forty-eight hours in the life of Lee Harvey Oswald. Based on the new book by Steve Gillon, the documentary starts off on the morning of November 22 and follows Oswald up until the time that he was killed by Jack Ruby. Experts like Gillon, Larry A. Sneed and Gary Mack are among the people who discuss what all happened in his final two days. I will say that I don't recall another documentary where the people interviewed seem so full of energy as if they're jumping out of their seats to talk about the subject. This here is certainly a good thing because they just keep this film moving so incredibly fast and it actually draws you into the material even more. I really thought this was an excellent documentary and especially if you're a history junkie or just want to know more about what happened after Oswald pulled the trigger. Some of the best moments talk about how the lead investigator was trying to get Oswald to trust him so that the suspected killer would open up more and talk. With that said, since there aren't any records of what Oswald said I'm not sure how much I buy into this. Still, this is a highly entertaining look at the various events that led to Oswald pulling the trigger to getting a gunshot himself.",

The personal stories of players and the opposing team about how Bryant was a dedicated and competitive athlete are true. The low rating for the doc isn't to discount their stories or the impact of Kobe.

They must have to make any serious money off accessories = purple purses and matching earrings and so forth...My overriding question is why did Bergé sell off everything the minute Saint Laurent was dead?....that does not speak of a healthy relationship no matter how you try to dress it up. People who really love someone want to leave everything the same. Some lame excuse is offered that a museum was too expensive, I don't buy it. Bergé got some enormous sum from the auction 500 million Euros or something.Bergé is a bit of a dour lower middle class pedestrian man strange combination. It is an interesting exploration of a successful gay man's life. How often do we see that?RECOMMEND 7 Stars",

Two young rappers go from Scotland to London to break into the music industry -- and when they fail, they go back again pretending to be American. And they make it. Almost.The personalities are fascinating, especially seeing the switch from interviews with Billy and Gavin to footage of Silibil & Brains on the rampage. The breathtaking, barefaced cheek of them, and the insane intensity of living in character, makes for irresistibly absorbing viewing.I'm also blown away at the central idea of their hoax: pretending to be foreign through national pride. Think about it. Yes, it's completely crackers. Barking bloody mad, in fact. But it's also absolute genius in my eyes.For me, the worst aspect of this film is the animation. It looks like an online ad, more or less, with just a little extra movement -- ugly designs, no flow, looks like it was coloured on MS Paint, etc -- but it's a fairly minor distraction.The only other negative is... well, the music industry. Because it's depressing as hell. But we knew that anyway, right?

Baime makes an unexpected discovery of a deeply held family secret, and once he finds out, the question is what he does with that information. I won't divulge anything more. The documentary could've gone in several ways but in the end, Baime, a very likable \"Joe Sixpack\" kinda guy, turns this into an uplifting story about unexpected family secrets.

            "storyline": "This documentary is complicated and tricky to follow and leaves many questions unanswered, but it's poetic and moving and its subject is important. George Packer has written about how Iraqis who worked for the Americans have been left hanging. It happened to members of the Laotian military who worked for the Americans during the \"secret\" (or more accurately denied) bombing of Laos during the Vietnam war--a campaign justified by the fact that the North Vietnamese conduit, the Ho Chi Mihn Trail, ran through Laos. The US was also supporting the Royal Laotian Army \"nautralist' forces against the communist Pathet Lao, as well as training Laotians to fight in US operations.The film shows JFK talking about the need for Laos's \"neutrality\" (and its cooperation against the communists) and Nixon denying the bombing. Titles give staggering statistics of how many bombs were dropped on Laos over a nine-year period by US planes--more than in World Wars I and II combined. There is no information about how many Laotians were killed.When America lost the war in Vietnam and pulled out, it also abandoned Laos and its Laotian collaborators. This affected Thavisouk Phrasavath (\"Thavi\"), a lean, toothy man who appears at various ages in the film, with hair sometimes down to his waist or his shoulders, in a crew-cut, or short and slicked back. This may reflect his struggle for an identity. He is the narrator of the film, its central figure, and the filmmaker's collaborator. The film, shot over a 23-year period, is the saga of a family torn apart by war and collaboration with the US, ending in uneasy settlement in America. The film's Laotian title, 'Nerakhoon,' actually means \"the betrayed ones.\" That is how Thavi came to think of his family members and those like them.Thavi grew up in Laos knowing only war. His father was one of those Laotian officers who, as he himself tells the camera, actually called in the American planes that dropped bombs on his country \"to save it.\" When the Americans abandoned Laos, the Pathet Lao took over. It was a happy moment, with celebration and singing everywhere. Then the Pathet came and took Thavi's father away for a reeducation \"seminar\"--imprisonment that lasted for years. From then on his family, his mother and nine children, lived in fear. Thavi, the eldest son, escaped on his own by swimming the Mekong River. In Thavi's words and images of the water, the film evokes that lonely swim, when he would have been happy to die if it came to that, to be \"gone and gone.\" Instead he woke up alive the next day in Thailand, and he became a street boy in Bankock for two years, when the rest of his family managed to come and they all went to a refugee camp. Well, not all: two elder sisters were not at home when the facilitator came to help the family flee across the river in a leaky boat, and their mother was forced to leave without them.'The Betrayal' blends period footage with impressionistic images of flight through woods backed up by the surging music of Howard Shore, and there are shots of Thavi talking. There is no footage of the family before it fled, but Kuras compensates with shots of people doing similar things.The big shock is what happens to the family when the mother chooses for them to be sent to the US rather than France or Canada, and they are dumped unceremoniously in a very dangerous part of Brooklyn in 1970. Without a father, in this ugly, hostile environment, the various siblings revolted, the girls hanging out with \"bad\" boys, the brothers joining gangs. There is a back-and-forth in the film between Thavi's mother speaking in the eighties in anger and despair about the bad pass the family came to at that time (Kuris discovered them around 1985) and today, more serenely recalling nearly forty years of struggle.After fifteen years the father found them and visited them from Florida. Like the takeover of the Pathet Lao, this was another moment of hope and happiness followed by despair, when he revealed after a week that he had another wife and children in Florida and was returning to them. We see Thavi calling his father later and quietly begging him to come and take things in hand, to no avail. Later, Thavi attends the funeral of one of his step brothers in Florida--a gang victim, the same \"reds\" gang there as in New York.Thavi referred to the analogy with Iraq in an interview at the Witness documentary film festival. There are over two million Iraqi refugees from the US invasion and occupation, and only a tiny handful have been accepted into the US. I think this larger implication is what Kuras and Phrasavath seek to communicate with the film's mix of poetry and devastation: that more than once America has made this \"mistake\" (Thavi's gentle word) of abandoning its collaborators too often must learn not to keep making it.What has happened to the family today? The film, too impressionistic at points, doesn't give many details. They don't live in Brooklyn any more (too gentrified and expensive?). The mother lives in New Jersey with a daughter, Thavi lives in New York with a wife and small child. He made a trip back to Laos and was reunited with the two lost older sisters, a grandmother who died at 104, and other family members. And to look at the other siblings, they've settled down and stabilized, but we don't know how they managed that, or any of the specifics about them, or what Thavi does now--but clearly he's a filmmaker, and a spokesman on the issues brought up in 'The Betrayal.' He's edited two other films related to immigration and border-crossing issues and he edited this one. This is well-known DP Kuras' directorial debut. Despite its flaws this is still a rich document.",

This treatment is supposed to flush out the \"toxins\" and \"repair\" the liver. Most of the \"research\" supporting the therapy is in the form of case studies by Max Gerson. The National Cancer Institute reviewed some of his case studies and found the method to be ineffective. Furthermore, the American Cancer Society has issued warnings that the method can be harmful and there have been reports of comas, seizures, and death resulting from extremely low sodium levels and imbalance of electrolytes in the patients undergoing the \"therapy.\".",

Also, a great deal of this material is taken from earlier documentaries, so is this done to bring it to a new audience, or is it done, ostensibly, to tell us something we didn't know before? The obvious answer is that it's done to sell programming while the subject might still capture enough interest to sell commercial time during it's broadcast. Ultimately, it's a lazy effort.The movie-maker/ interviewer(s) insert themselves too often, obviously seeking to drive a narrative, spice things up, or allude to or imply something that otherwise isn't brought up by the subjects of the documentary.This is, at best, a 20 minute documentary dragged out to.......

It turns out that research has shown that immersion in nature helps dealing with PTSD. The veterans tell their personal stories along the way...Couple of comments: this one-off standalone episode of the National Geographic deals with a very important cause: how to help veterans dealing with PTSD. It is something that is far too often overlooked, and it's simply not right. Tens of thousands of veterans returning from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are left to their own devices in dealing with it. For shame. From scientific research we now know that immersion in awe-inspiring nature surroundings help dealing with PTSD. Whitewater rafting is one example. Exploring nature near and at the Arctic circle is another one. In this episode, 5 veterans get the opportunity to do so, and do, and very happy for them. All that aside, does this make for compelling viewing? I'm afraid not. There are far better \"extreme nature\" documentaries out there as compared to this one. That of course does not take away from the important cause that this documentary represents.\"Operation Arctic Cure\" premiered on the National Geographic Channel some weeks ago and is now streaming on Hulu, where I caught it. If you have any interest in how veterans deal with PTSD, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

One paper shows that cancer rates are higher where the radioactive plume fell. Another paper explains the disparity between official expectations of illness and the observed higher rate--in part because the expectations accounted for short-lasting gamma radiation and not fat-soluble beta radiation.The film notes that the efforts of these women did not stop the reopening of TMI after six years--but did help scuttle more than 100 planned nuclear plants.Well worth seeing.",

We don't find out what makes Mr van Noten tick, let along create. Nevertheless, this gives you and me an insight into a quiet achiever, with none of the flash and eccentricity of Valantino or Lagerfeld, and Iris Apfel, a wonderful eccentric, gives him credit and validates that modern fashion is a conveyor belt and that designers do better as independents. But I still don't feel I learnt what fires up Dries van Noten.",

The devotion of Hannah and her husband moved mountains and helped Vajrayana Buddhism to survive the genocide the Chinese brought over Tibet.Hannah Nydahl was one of the few Westerners who at the time of Flower Power could recognize the vast values and qualities of Buddhist practice beyond all exotica. Her activity to give a broad audience the access to the Tantric teachings of Buddhism is touching and really inspiring. The documentary wins with its authentic protagonists and the historical footage of Buddhism spreading from the Himalayas to the West.",

I watched this film, expecting to be moved, expecting to feel their pain, expecting to understand something about it, anything about it. I felt nothing but disbelief as several continued on as if their biggest concern was jail. I didn't feel their grief. I didn't like any of them, except the mother of the first child whose death they delved into. Perhaps it was a poor job of directing, perhaps I'm just incapable of understanding how one forgets something so important in a vehicle. We got through 40 minutes of this, and I couldn't take anymore. Someone can talk about how they felt suicidal, or how they felt like they couldn't go on, but if I don't \"feel\" that coming from you, I don't believe a word of it. The death of a child breaks my heart. This documentary just made me sick with rage.",

Now that I've seen this film on Amazon Prime I intend to share it with my Christian father and see what happens. I get the impression that he's the one who will be more accepting than my mom. I've dropped a lot of hints, so I doubt he'll be surprised. But he still might be surprised. So I hope it goes well.I think the movie does a pretty fair job of letting both the father and son present their case for their position. I felt they both had likable moments. And I really respected the respect and love they showed each other. Far too often there are stories of parents disowning their kids when they leave the family's faith. I hope that this film can provide an example of how it's possible to set religion aside and remember that there if far more to every person than the religion they say they identify or don't identity with.Kudos to both of them and kudos to the mom as well. Even though she isn't interviewed, she has a positive presence within the story.I give it a 9 just because there were a couple moments where I wish the humanist had answered or addressed somethings a bit differently. But overall I'm very glad I saw it. And I hope it will yield good results for me and my parents as we enter a new stage in our association with each other.",

It is a well-made informative history of how venture capitalists have played a crucial behind the scenes role in shaping our technology-driven culture. The film would work as parallel to films that described the history of the technology from the viewpoint of the geeks – particularly Robert Cringley's History of the Nerds (1996) and Nerds 2.0 (1998).Something Ventured is essentially an oral history of the now elderly men who funded and developed companies like Intel, Genentech, Apple, Atari, and Cisco which have shaped so much of our modern world. The film is well-edited and the story is told in an entertaining and informative manner that serves to relate a positive view of the best of what American capitalism can do (as contrasted with a film like Inside Job which shows American capitalism at its worst and most exploitative). It shows how entrepreneurs with great ideas teamed with investors with money have transformed the world in a variety of amazing ways.As essentially an oral history, the film is really told from the perspective of the venture capitalists themselves. This is a valuable narrative, but what is missing from the film is a dissenting voice that critiques and analyzes their actions and shows the negative impact of their products, ideas, and process. Something Ventured aims to tell a single narrative of the history rather than attempting for some form of objective analysis. The filmmakers seem to have gotten too close to their subjects who as was stated in the Q&A session they view as \"heroes.\" There is never a sense of self-reflection or evaluation of how their efforts have affected the broader society - both positively and negatively. There is no questioning of the environmental or social effects of their achievements. It would have been useful to allow this critical voice to enter their project. In a democracy, allowing dissent strengthens rather than weakens a project. While they have produced a very valuable film, they have also missed an opportunity to view it through a self-critical lens.",

Now that fashion magazines with fashions ads and newsstands at every corner are long in the past, these jobs don't exist anymore.Besides that these various jobs around models and fashion models (or used to) exist, and they revolve around repetitive tasks, there's not much beyond that in this doc.I wish it were more like the Wiseman's other docs, where you can determine who these people were (especially the models, who all come off as very vapid pretty faces), and how well they were actually doing their jobs. I don't know who was good or bad at their job, unlike his other docs I've seen. I'd love to know something at stake for the \"perfect\" shot or cover vs. Just good enough. What a \"perfect\" image meant to magazine sales or ad revenue.Overall a disappointment, seeing how some of his earlier work I've seen are darn near perfect.",

But endless respect for her journey, talent, fearlessness, and as is revealed, vulnerability. She just seems like a very likable person who undoubtedly deserves even more credit for storied career, maybe even a statue in New Orleans somewhere, or hell, even a postal stamp (see another New Orleanian Michael Deas for that one).

            "storyline": "Shouting Down Midnight was received with great excitement at its world premiere at SXSW in Austin, Texas. For those of us who were part of the fight against these oppressive laws in 2013, it was inspirational and uplifting and brought people back to the exciting events of the Wendy Davis filibuster almost a decade ago. The film is beautifully made and edited with much love and care and really tries to contextualize the filibuster moment within the larger decades long struggle for reproductive rights in Texas. For me, it brought back an excitement and joy of those iconic moments that are part of Austin progressive history. The film tried to build on the enthusiasm, mobilization, and activism of that moment. It focused on some of the activists who were inspired by the moment and have gone on to continue the fight.But it was also a celebration of what was really a glorious failure. The bill passed, and while parts of it were eventually overturned by the Supreme Court, it remained part of the long downward spiral of reproductive freedom in Texas. In a way, it seemed deeply detached from the current reality in Texas where abortion has already been banned at 6 weeks from conception. All the invocations to organize and vote seemed a little hollow at this moment when the battle is about to be lost in June's upcoming Supreme Court ruling which will likely lead to the outlawing of abortion in this state in the coming months. While a beautifully made documentary, I found it terribly bittersweet. It is trying to celebrate a brief victory on a long road of failure and despair. The film preaches to a choir that is searching for hope when there is really none to be found for those who care deeply about this issue. Of course, hope is a necessary component of activism, but maybe this movement also needs a bit more hard-headed realism and bit less celebration of the glorious failure of a just and righteous cause.",

            "storyline": "I am a dues-paying advocate of the North American Bigfoot Center and believe that Sasquatch is a real, living creature. Groups like the NABC, BFRO, the Olympic Project, and various scientific researchers like Dr. John Bindernagel, Dr. Jeff Meldrum and the late Dr. Grover Krantz, have gathered enough evidence to convince me that very large apes are alive and well in the vast reaches of our forests. And the cultural histories of many Native American and First Nations peoples include stories and beliefs about non-human \"people\" of the wild. Many of these descriptions bear a striking resemblance to the hairy man-like creatures reported today. I have always found that to be most convincing.But, as with many other subjects that are on the outlying borders of what is generally accepted by mainstream science and society in general, there will always be certain kinds of people who infuse such subjects with what is known as the \"woo woo\" factor. (Woo woo refers to paranormal, or fringe religious beliefs, and other forms of \"New Age\" philosophy. And the woo woo is definitely applied liberally to the subject of this film).This is the second release of the \"Flash of Beauty\" film series. This edition, titled \"Paranormal Bigfoot,\" includes many of the same witnesses as we saw in the first film, only now we are presented with tales of people who claim to have had psychic interactions with Sasquatch, that a Sasquatch can \"cloak\" in order to become invisible, can disappear by moving through portals or dimensional shifts, can \"shapeshift\" into other animals, and the suggestion that they ride around in glowing orbs of light or UFOs.I'll go ahead and say that, while I will always respect the beliefs, practices and choices of others as to what they want to believe, I'm definitely one of those persons who prefers to stick with hard science and tangible evidence, so far as this subject is concerned. So yes, I was a bit put off with the heavy emphasis of the film along these kinds of woo woo lines.I own a copy of the first \"A Flash of Beauty\" release, titled, \"Bigfoot Revealed.\" That film was much more grounded in science and consisted mainly of interviews with witnesses who recounted their Bigfoot encounters, along with a few photos, videos, and physical evidence, such as hairs and track impressions. Pretty straightforward, well-grounded stuff, and typical of other good Sasquatch documentaries. (I gave \"Bigfoot Revealed\" a much higher rating on here).I want to include here that I don't completely dismiss claims of the paranormal. And if real evidence comes forward that can definitively show that these creatures can do any of the things that the witnesses claim in this film, I'll be as excited as anyone else. But right now, I tend to prefer Sasquatch evidence that can be measured in a laboratory or examined scientifically.If you enjoy Bigfoot documentaries, but are skeptical of extraordinary claims that are firmly rooted in the realm of the supernatural, then you may feel that you wasted your time watching this film. Be prepared for a whole lot of New Age Woo Woo throughout.",

Alton had quit the movie business after working on Elmer Gantry (1960), and for many years, even close friends didn't know his whereabouts, or if he was still alive. In 1992, McCarthy was shocked to receive a phone call from the now 91-year-old Alton, who had heard about Visions of Light (1992), and wanted to attend the premiere. Alton insisted that there was nothing mysterious in his disappearance, that he and his wife had simply decided to give up the movie business and travel a bit. They had lived in France, Germany, and Argentina, and had a great time. Alton died in 1996 at the age of 95.",

In \"Mystery of the Nile\" showing on the giant screen of the Mugar Omni Theaer, audiences witness the expedition team's journey over 114 days, more than 3,000 miles by kayak and raft, facing nearly every imaginable danger, from deadly rapids and violent bandits to blinding sandstorms and tropical diseases.",

It would be a fair assumption that this is no coincidence.History is always open to interpretation and some may argue that someone other, than Pissarro, is \"The Father of Impressionism\" but that has little to no baring on the quality of this work.Sometimes... you get the feeling that you may have dished out that tenth star a bit too flippantly. Bickerstaff's presentation of Pissarro, and indeed Impressionism as a whole, not only hits the documentary sweet spot, he hits it right out of the park. He creates a sense of loss, a loss of that eleventh star to hand out on rare occasions.For anyone remotely interested in Impressionism - this is a \"must see\".",

Alternating the stories of 3 of the 8 fighters of the Vale Tudo--a no-holds-barred fighting tournament held in Tokyo--during the months leading up to the event, Goodman is able to capture what so many Van Damme movies have failed to do: put you in the mind set of a fighter: the adrenaline, the fear, the pain, the shame, the glory. Goodman resists making overt judgments about whether these violent events are good or bad, but he does so deliberately; by avoiding investigating or answering the question head-on, he allows the characters to develop and express HIS feelings simply through THEIR action. His voice is heard, but not identified as his. This is nimble and talented directing. But the Director's steady hand does not resist exposing the personal hypocricies of the fighters, nor does he shy away from the occasional cynical moment. The 3 fighters CHOKE follows are so different from each other that one might think they were cast. But I don't think you could cast so realistically. No one would believe it. RICKSON GRACIE is the handsome, unbelievable talented, undefeated World Champion ju-jitsu wrestler from Brazil who puts his family's heritage on the line every time he fights. He risks losing everything he stands for if he will be defeated. (The training footage of him in unbelievable!). TODD HAYES is the huge pro-football player who figths in order to pay for a bobsled so he can compete with the US Olympic bobsledding team. KOICHURO KIMURA is the overgrown man-child who fights because his wrestling coach wants him to, it seems. (the only slowish parts of CHOKE are those that follow Kimura's plight--and even these become exciting at the end...). I looked for other documentaries or features from the Director but could not find any. If CHOKE is his first film, I can't wait to see his second. Bravo.",

So one must ask themselves, is it for a hefty payday to lure them out of semi anonymous safe haven of post incarceration OR does she still seek some of the infamy and attention that drove her to the crimes she admits to? (if it's the former, why are we so fascinated and starved for content, that we permit what is in my opinion ultimately a reward for her actions)All in all I am, whilst being a male born in LA and raised in Bel Air (even attending a school that had its own continuation school called Indian Springs which we referred to as Indica Springs cause ya know... Right?) and having some empathy in those regards, first hand understanding of that environment of interacting with celebrity yet not being anything extraordinary - and of course merely being a human that was a teenager at some point but ultimately I'm unimpressedBy both the film AND Rachel Lee// as an afterthought, and this is kinda funny and kinda like.. remember I said I had some empathy but not much sympathy, so get this, when I was still in elementary school, there was a kid on my street that had a bad reputation, I can attest he was a bully and, let's say ne'er-do-well. So for a stretch of time there were burglaries in bel air and eventually my family returned from vacation and the house had been robbed - there was a huge greasy palm print on my bedroom window (I had nightmares for months, I was a kid, gimme a break lol) so anyway it turns out that when the caught the gang of kids that did it, that boy was the main dude right? Turned out he went on to have a fairly successful career as an actor - and cause I don't think anyone will read this far I'll tell you his name (we're already on imdb, check him out, you totally recognize him) David Bowe, his girlfriend and Co. Robbed houses AND the school in bel air hahaha - what a Richard right? Funny stuff! Sorry David, some people don't forget.",

Today, the elixir may have been replaced by \"anti-ageing\" creams and dietary regimens, but the primal desire to be young forever is as strong in us as it was in our ancestors. This film depicts the stories of 50 different women, and in doing so takes an incisive look at their deepest desires, fears, hopes and vulnerabilities. In doing so, it captures the very essence of womanhood, an essence that transcends the bounds of time and space. The depictions of the women's bodies complement the narrative, showing the hidden desperation of maintaining an all-too-fleeting beauty. As a woman myself, this film tugged at my heartstrings.",

Of course, as viewers of his film, anyone is entitled to imagine alternate motivations for the making of Bleed Out - as a few cynical reviewers have posited. Some suggest he made the film and let the lawsuit linger to somehow benefit his own life? My goodness, no. I've known Steve for over a decade...first as a comedy director who shot several commercials for me, and now as a close friend who resurfaced after 10 years of taking care of his mother. Shooting this film was never his goal... In fact, the moment he left LA for Wisconsin he gave up working as a director - meaning, he was without an income, facing mounting medical bills on behalf of his mother, and putting his career and life on hold indefinitely - the entire time he took care of Judy because that was the only choice in his mind. Nearly half of his professional life disappeared as he did the only thing he knew how to do...love his mom, and use his skills to document her unacceptable medical \"care\". Before Bleed Out, Steve wrote, acted and directed the silliest - dare I say sophomoric - work you can imagine. Google Glass Nickel Pizza for a laugh. Or track down his feature film Chump Change - the cameos from legendary comedic actors alone are worth it. That's the Steve I know. Always upbeat. Always grateful for his success (I watched him shake every hand of his crew after a shoot once, look them in the eye, and say thank you before he would even think of wrapping for the night). Steve is pure positivity. Even in the face of the most harrowing events in his personal life. Watch his film and take it at face value. There is nothing other than what you see. He had no other agenda. Once you accept that, you'll understand how heartbreaking - and heartwarming - his experience has been.",

John McEnroe and his doubles partner give great insight as well when the film covers the tennis aspects of this man.

This documentary follows one 26-year old man's quest in losing his virginity by completing the course. Understandably, there is some good to be had in this course. It allows those who have anxiety when dealing with sex to overcome this overbearing obstacle. But, this documentary doesn't focus on that. No, it instead focuses on the immediate thirst for losing one's virginity. Feeding the typical heterosexual's complex that is corrupting young people today. Losing one's virginity is not a big issue. It isn't. And unfortunately films and documentaries like this won't let this non-issue disappear.However, that's not what makes this film pointless. It acts as advertisement for this course, which is fine. But once this \"boy becomes a man\" and completes the course, he actually says a line that omits the entire existence of this documentary and the course it loving shows off. \"After completing the course, I had a revelation. I realise that sex is not essential\". I paused, went back a few seconds and heard it again. He literally demolished the purpose of this course in one sentence, yet probably paid thousands of pounds just to lose his virginity to someone he has no attraction to. The course won't change his mentality when he meets someone he is actually attracted to. It's just a status change. Enabling him to say \"yeah, I've had a sex. I'm a man now\". Oh give me a break. An anger inducing piece of stupidity that is a clear indicator of how ridiculous social normality has become.",

It's also about what we knew where coming, but that no one wanted to hear.We follow a couple of politicians from Norway on their inquest trip to U.S., amongst other places Detroit City. We see how Detroit was Silicon Valley of the World, and now is bankrupt. Also that this economy is ready to move on to the next revolution. It's about how bank swindlers still are working together with governments to save bankrupt mastodon banks, saved by the politicians which are supported by the very same banks to get elected. How bad loans where hidden in new products, which governments don't stop due to their dance with big economy. did you know that both Bush and Obama's biggest sponsors where the big banks which made this swindle possible? Did you know that the financial crises of Greece is based on the same? Greece took contact with Goldman Sachs to fool Europe into accepting Greece into the Euro zone? It's all a catastrophe zone and the criminals are not the ones suffering. They are saved and has become rich. The scientists and Nobel price winners here tell how important it is that government rules, and regulate the financial market. The same market which was allowed by politicians and government to swindle money into their own pockets.What's even worse, is that those countries who have given away all industrial production to Africa and Asia. The Western world will see that USA and Europe will get poorer, and the underdeveloped countries will get richer.I think the film is done in an interesting way. we get facts along the way, in interesting interviews. A documentary which is done in an exciting way.A super film to use in economical education about the economical system and how crises work, and how they affect the little man, far away from those who speculates with money and loans. 1,5 hours well spent!",

It uses snappy MTV style editing intercut with subliminal real life war footage , dramatic reconstructions and interviews . It is the antithesis of the present day zeitgeist of being anti-war and makes no apology for it so much so that I almost feel ashamed that I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary . Anyone got a problem that it's feel good TV seeing violent theocrats with guns and RPGs getting shot dead ? No ? GoodCertainly this will upset the usual suspects who feel the need to protest war especially if it involves a democracy defeating a tyranny but no one is being conscripted in to watching something they don't want to watch . There is a lot of technical lingo in between the scenes of carnage which fly by so quickly you'll have to rewatch the documentary again to catch it in full . From a pedantic film making point of view you could say the in your face graphics detract from what's being said but I'd happily watch this again and enjoy it There is a somewhat American-centric feel to it featuring mainly snipers from the USMC in Vietnam , Iraq and Afghanistan and possibly somewhat conscious of this INSIDE THE CROSSHAIRS has former British army sniper Mark Spicer as one of the talking heads and features Canadian soldier Rob Furlong record breaking feat of killing a Taliban fighter from a distance of almost one and a half miles away , a record that stood for seven and a half years where it was broken by Craig Harrison of the British army in November 2009 One other thing I did notice was the constant references to football fields . It take it that'd be one hundred yards ? The script refers to distances as in 500 yards , 600 yards 700 yards etc but then feels the need to point out that that's 6 football fields , or 7 football fields etc . So if you hate football fields as much as you hate war porn you will hate this documentary",

            "storyline": "There is a significant reason to watch the documentary about Reality Winner -- the fact that the justice system, in its unbelievable lack of insight, is willing to sentence her to serve a 5-year prison term says volumes about the insidiousness of our twisted democratic ideals.In Reality's case, when she found out that there was a definite attempt to manipulate the election by Russian insiders, her actions should be rewarded with a medal of honor -- instead, she was vilified and chastised for telling the American public that our country is being decimated by outside forces. What could possibly be more honorable? The mere suggestion that she was un-American is completely manipulated and false. Her intentions were nothing but selfless and attempts to rescue our democratic way of life.But the Justice system does not see this case for what it is, a blatant attempt by the multi-headed hydra that is the Trump-era brand Republican movement to silence anyone that could be antithetical to the dictatorial regime that they would like to impose. So Reality had to be shut away from any news media, from anyone who could even give her any support, including her own family.The documentary centers on Reality's Mom, Billie, who shows herself to be as selfless as her daughter and who works night and day to see that the case against her daughter is reversed, to no avail. Finally, we watch as Reality is silenced again and again, and the futility in Billie's face and voice is almost too difficult to witness.Kudos to the micro crew that brought her story to the public, and the film is well put together, with only a couple of minor flaws. When Reality calls in (which is the only way we can hear her voice, since she is forbidden from talking to the media), we sometimes miss some words as a result of the tinny phone speaker. This is a minor issue, and could have been easily dealt with by adding some captions to the video.One other, very minor point -- the name \"Reality\" is explained quite late in the film -- as one of the big questions in everyone's mind is, how did she ever win such a great name? Was it a trick of fate, or was she destined to be remembered for the amazing person she turned out to be?",

            "storyline": "*NO SPOILER, BUT A VERY GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING* I'm not a great Leonard Cohen fan, but now he is topical (i.e. just died) this film is getting shown on the television so it got left on last night. His music is OK, the words are poetic but the melody and accompanying music Seems somewhat monotonal and often distractingly off-key. Maybe this is so as to not detract from the lyrics and as a delivery method it is reasonably effective. The musical content aside, this is no ground-breaking film. That it was pieced back together from 3000 clips is impressive, but not as awesome as if it had been a more interesting subject - it's a music tour documentary and it's pretty run-of-the-mill; you like the ones about a band you love and otherwise just go \"meh, seen it all before\". The director is not one I've seen any work of previously, and I'm not likely to want hunt his work out in the future. Footage has been worked in to accompany some of the songs and, whilst it may be fitting to the subject, is not always what you might expect and here's the crux of my review: there's one part of the film that I'm now always now going to associate with this artist every time I hear one of his songs and it's not right that I should because it's not his fault, it's the director's. The film contains actual footage of an actual person being actually executed. If you don't know it's coming it is actually disturbing and will actually stay with you for the rest of your life. There's other images of people being horribly killed, but the one that sticks with me is of a man being shot in the head in Vietnam, complete with all the images of what happens to a person when they are executed in this manner. The still photo from this footage is well known, but I didn't know it comes from a film. Now i know it does and won't forget it. It's not Hollywood, it's graphic in the way you know only real life can be. So if you want to see a fairly drab 70s \"rockumentary\" and never see life in quite the same way again, watch this film. Otherwise go buy an album and enjoy the pictures you choose to put in your head rather than those another interpret's for you, which has always been the point of poetry, hasn't it?",

This documentary expands upon that and takes a more artistic approach into depicting the culture. This documentary is definitely not for everyone as it's quite unique and brings in a lot of artistic elements that one doesn't normally see in a standard documentary. I would say this first artistic cut aways of a Pompeiian myth is quite unnecessarily long. I had to check if I was watching the same show still.",

Daynes really did not fit that profile.This programme contains some dramatised scenes as well as interviews with Breck's family and school friends talking about Breck and how they feared that Breck was being manipulated by Daynes with lies. Daynes groomed Breck for a year so he could lure Breck to his flat in order to kill him.The programme also talk to the police who investigated the crime and try to piece together what happened.I can imagine it was very hard for the family to talk on camera and the reason they did it was to highlight the dangers of online gaming where people are not what they pretend to be. It would had been equally difficult for his friends to talk to the camera who are still teenagers. I think the programme-makers were sensitive to this as we could see this when they were setting up some of the interviews.It is a difficult and harrowing programme to watch if you are a parent, but it is important that teenage kids see it.",

The aliens are NOT your friends! I am also not waiting ANOTHER 22 years for ~NOTHING~ to happen. Only the most naive among us still hold out hope that the next 2 decades are going to be any different in terms of results. Not to mention the vast amounts of disinformation about the aliens themselves Greer is spouting, which is truly astounding! They are NOT your \"friends\". They are NOT here to help anyone. They don't want to educate you, or heal you OR help you be a better human being! They only protect this planet and it's lifeforms because THEY are the ones who 'seeded' everything on it from weeds to whales. This planet is NOT an \"experiment\", it is a 'FARM' essentially where anything and anyone can be taken and used whenever and however it, or they are needed, or it suits them. The landlords have changed over the last few billion years, but the purpose is basically the same. The earth 'houses' very diverse and valuable life forms! Mainly because it's a water-planet.Example: Do you think the dinosaurs just suddenly evolved from a single cell and became vastly numerous and highly evolved reptile species in less than a billion years? That isn't even scientifically OR biologically possible! Were they brought here from perhaps a another world? A dying world? Were they again taken away to somewhere else when it became time to utilize this planet for other, more pragmatic uses such as mining, or rendering the production of other newly found or genetically created species? Think very hard here. This planet IS the property of other, more highly evolved species. And they utilize every living resource on it, and within it. We are all just 'Free Range' humans until they decide they need one of us to fulfill a purpose. Sometimes they bring us back, but more often they don't. Think bigger...Call it a gut-hunch. But it's also the fact that his story is changing now about how our own government is now responsible for abductions and many of the crafts we see. I know when someone I trusted is now doing the slow con-job on me. It's been a full generation of humanity since he started 'Disclosure' and NOTHING has ever been disclosed except a couple Tic-Tac videos. Seriously? I honestly just get a very dishonest vibe from him now. One that has been growing for a number of years now. I believe full well that many humans are being taken every year and are not being returned, though some are. Alien species are no more kind and benevolent to humans than a farmer is to his livestock. I get my information from a LOT of sources, and the most reliable among them all agree that this planet is a 'Harvest Planet'. That every living thing from weeds to Redwoods, and from mosquitos to whales were 'seeded' here for a purpose. There just has NOT been enough time for so many species to have actually \"evolve\" in the amount of time given. I should maybe leave it at that. It is SO much bigger than people know. And even if they did, they would seriously wish they didn't. Cheers! (Look up Derrel Sims if you want the REAL truth!) ...STAY CLEAR OF GREER!!",

This exploration of Aum Shinrikyo, who is responsible for attack, involves the participation of those who lived through the horror as it unfolded. The Shinrikyo group are some of the strangest organizations when it came to religious context and there are a lot of interesting things to explore about this group. This documentary does offer some interesting ideas but they are a little messy.For starters, the visual presentation of the documentary is well shot. The production, lightening and sound aspects were pretty good and helped to add some flavor of the setting and environment. The filmmakers clearly are passionate about telling the story of the real life Shinrikyo organization and there are some interesting ideas explored. Subjects involved with the group provided interesting stories and facts about what they experienced and some of the dark sides behind the scenes.But the problems are that the film doesn't have an even structure as it goes all over the place. Where one thing is being discussed and all of a sudden goes to another and forgets about the previous discussion that was mentioned. There are some moments about the corrupted side of the police system and darker sides of the group that were very interesting but they weren't explored to it's potential.I kinda of wished this documentary was a mini-series rather than just one film because there are tons of aspects that could have been explored. Overall, despite my gripes, I still did enjoy for the most part of the film but there could have been more to it.Rating: B-",

Advertisements for the documentary featured a larger than life image of the guillotine, along with a blurb that hints: surely the French can't be all that bad, having given the world such a highly efficient machine of death. The result is a pathetic turn of 'meat and potatoes' history as only can be served up by THC.I must agree with most other reviewers that this documentary retells the events of one of the world's most complex and important revolutions in the broadest of terms. Accuracy is sacrificed to sensationalism, and the guillotine is the star of the show. Clearly the producers are pandering to what they believe to be a anti-French, bloodthirsty American public.I must also counter one reviewer who claims that Marie Antoinette never wore elaborate hairstyles or extravagant gowns. Indeed she did, during the first 4-years or so of her reign. Countless paintings, prints and memoirs cannot be ignored. It was not until the 1780s that Marie Antoinette took on the simple cottons and printed muslin dresses so necessary to the rustic yet refined style of living she adopted at her private estate of Trianon. Moreover, the queen nearly lost her ability to speak German , and this fact is well documented by several contemporaries, most notably the Baronne d'Oberkirch. Of all foreign princesses who married into the Bourbon dynasty, Marie Antoinette eventually spoke French with the greatest skill, and it was not long before she lost all traces of her Austrian German accent.It seems that the French Revolution, and Marie Antoinette, continue to spawn myths and half-truths, and the History Channel, with its documentary, has done nothing to substantiate historical accuracy.",

Wade. It's also an outright demand that media stop shirking their responsibility and start covering women's health issues.The film is a tragicomedy. On the one hand, well-known comedians like Margaret Cho, Sarah Silverman and more, hilariously take the stage in various cities for the Vaginal Mystery Tour to help raise money which will, though the Abortion Access Front, provide health care to U. S. women in Republican states whose cities have become medical deserts. There is no health care in those cities; the only option for medical assistance is driving hours across borders.The other part of the film takes us into the clinics that are on the front lines of the battle. We meet the healthcare workers and doctors who are now unable to continue providing medical care to their patients. Whose budgets have been slashed. Who fight the lies being pushed by the religious right regarding choice.

This documentary was obviously mainly filmed pre-covid so this may be a difficult watch if you are in any way pining for the dancefloor, filled with people close enough to touch. It seems a very long time ago that clubbing as it was ever happened, the question is will it ever return?This is a fairly straight forward documentary about one of the pioneers of not just techno but dance music, as well as being one of the worlds best DJ's ever.While the current trend in techno is the female model/ex-model/could be a model Instagram influencer, real techno fans know where the real talent is. And unfortunately for the social media platforms, these are basically 50 years plus men with greying hair (or bald). The point is their looks aren't their selling point.Unlike many music documentaries this is highly engaging and will be for people who have no idea who LG is. This isn't just fan service. What is striking about this documentary is the obsessive love of music that this man has, it is also what he went through in order to fulfil his career as a DJ, producer and event planner. There are many high profile DJs but its very unlikely they will have a history that compares. His emotion when he plays as well as that of crowd is captured perfectly.This is also essential viewing for anyone interested in the history of dance music who isn't from France, simply because the UK and US stories of dance music tend to over shadow the French story. It needed to be told.This has very high production values, however there are one or two issues I would raise with.First is that the Blessed Madonna who appears was previously named the Black Madonna and was forced into a name change for obvious reasons. The late-ish release of this documentary should have meant the credits reflected this name change.The other aspect is the argument for dance music to be political. I disagree. The fact is that dance music blew away the politics from clubs, certainly in the UK. So the argument made that it should be political tends to come from people who didn't experience political or other types of violence in nightlife (ie the young), which dance music eradicated.The other issue is that the people who make this argument tend to be left wing, they want to mobilise dance music fans into their causes. Which is what happened when the right tried to take over the skinhead movement in the UK. It leads to nothing but conflict, the thing is once you make it political, the politicians turn up and both sides turn up. You cant/wont have a left wing without a right. We are seeing this already across Europe and its leading to the closing of events.So its a great documentary but one of the messages is definitely questionable, keep politics out of dance music!",

The movie is not one minute too long. It is easy to watch - like a long story of gossips. And this is also my main problem with this movie. So many stories are told to the man behind the camera. Very often stories about how another person was killed, robbed or otherwise treated badly. Can I believe these people shown? I am sure, some of them exaggerated, because in my experience everybody exaggerates when he tells a story to another person. What also remains as feeling is that every bad situation that hits an Iraqi is provoked by an enemy. There was not one Iraqi who put some blame on himself that they endured a dictatorship, that they got robbed (by their own people), that the streets are unsafe etc. All the time others have done something terrible wrong. Another problem of this documentary is that it seems that Abbas Fahdel seems to be part of an intellectual family. And so we see mostly the world through their eyes. We do not see the separation between possessors and non-possessors. Fahdel gives the impression that there is no tension between the middle class and the poor. The months before the beginning of war everybody was kind of excited - like expecting the beginning of a soccer world championship. The whole documentary is too biased. No wonder, because it is the story of one family. But if you have the chance to see this documentary - with all its shortcomings - go and see it!!!",

At the beginning ,what's bred in the bone comes out in the flesh : in 'the woman of straw \" ,he wears the same suit as in \"Goldfinger\" .His sheet anchor was director Sidney Lumet who gave him a role which would be his very favorite : \"the hill\" ,a settlement of scores with his time in the British Navy and his Bond-rock of Sysiphus ; later he would completely destroy his sexy macho image in the absorbing \"the offense \" ; Two hustonesque works -even though the latter was directed by Huston followed :\"the lion and the wind\" ,and mainly my personal favorite \"the man who would be king \" in which he and Caine blew your mind .If the late seventies were less successful , the eighties and nineties showed that he was not a spent force .Like Robert Anderson , who urged him to become an actor,he became a mentor for the young actor of \"finding Forrester\" ;full circle indeed. The star had not forgotten his destitute childhood .Includes interventions of Andy Garcia (\"the untouchables\") and John Boorman (\"Zardoz\" ,with a funny anecdote ).",

I've watched a few films and TV shows about UFO abductions but I've always taken them as entertainment and nothing else. This movie challenged my assumptions.\nPersonally, I've never believed in aliens, but if space is infinite then it has to be possible that some other form of life may exist somewhere.\nBeing Taken uses a compilation of footage from different sources which gives it almost a found footage effect. Overall it is very entertaining and really funny at times. The various testimonies tell a compelling story and the 'abductees' themselves come across as being truthful and credible.\nWhatever your take on the subject, even if you are a skeptic like me, you will find this film thoroughly thought provoking!",

For 90 minutes, it gets the best of all areas of science and some areas of advocacy. I love the breadth of information from historical to international. It is intersectional and includes diverse presentations of genders and ages (the bench scene at the end is my favorite moment for parent/child dyads to watch!). I recommend all my clients with trans family members watch this.P.S. Not everyone needs or desires medical intervention. I am disappointed in the hateful reviews here that have been found \"helpful\" and are full of disinformation. This video affirms guidelines and statements made by the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Physician Assistants, American College of Nurse Midwives, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Public Health Association, and the Endocrine Society. Transgender health is not some \"experimental psychiatric treatment method\" as other reviews have espoused. Internationally, medical intervention has been provided to transgender individuals since the 1900s. Those records were burned by the Nazis in 1933. I worry about those who support the hateful 1-star ratings of this title.",

It follows a group of activists - old and young - as they try to fight for democracy against an overwhelming political and authoritarian regime and at times it uses actuality to potently illustrate the dangerous predicament faced by those opposed to the increasing limitation of their freedoms. The thing about the actual documentary, though, is that is mixes fact and \"faction\" in a way that is sometimes none too clear. The camera work is intimate amidst the scenes of protestation, but it isn't always obvious what is real and what is staged. The narrative is clear enough - and, uniquely, demonstrates to the audience just how the locals have gone full circle from being Chinese under colonial rule, to autonomous under communist rule to now, to a large extent, wanting to be independent Hongkongers. Unlike so many other subjects of the CCP state, many of these individuals grew up with freedoms - of sex, education, liberation and having had what they are now beginning to lose and miss, there is an enhanced traction derived from their demonstrations against an authority that reminds one of David and Goliath. The chronology of that struggle is also a little muddled, I found. We move from 1967 to 1973 to now, via a series of troubles dating from the governments of both east and west and I could have been doing with a more defined structure to make it easier to follow whom, what, where, when - that context is lacking and so the narrative judders about unnecessarily. It's clearly a labour of love from this director, and some of the imagery is raw and, frankly, brutal and deeply though-provoking. Crowd funded, it is a testament to those involved that it got made at all, and it s certainly worth a watch - but perhaps a rebuild might prove more informative and useful for those less familiar with the issues and the language.",

The music of the documentary (a breathtaking piano melody) is touching and poetic, and includes at the end an \"unnamed\" cool Tango written by Viktor Frankl. The clips of the interviews and lectures by Frankl are really interesting, and the collaborations of many people that knew Frankl give us a beautiful picture of his humanity.

There are moments of danger and you can feel that at any point the front line is only a few miles away but for the most part it is the honesty and the fear of the \"characters\" that shines through.This creates a deeply moving and confronting account of the war and the way it can very quickly turn the lives of people just like you and me upside down. From old ladies hiding under the couch as their apartments are shelled to victims of torture reliving their experiences in the cells they were kept in, it is the normalcy of the people in this film - facing an extraordinary situation - that makes it so compelling and powerful.It references some of the misinformation about the war in Western media without fanning the flames or taking a tit-for-tat approach. Instead letting the stories of the people in the film speak for themselves. It's a harrowing and eye opening documentary well worth a watch if you want to know what's really happening in Ukraine.",

This is simply not true and historically inaccurate.The two \"specialists\" in the documentary that provide details are Muslims that clearly have a very biased and one sided opinion.The documentary fails to mention the Islamic caliphates from 600 - 1000AD that absolutely decimated nation after nation town after town through out the whole Middle East. Killing, raping, kidnapping, forcing conversions, forcing militarisation etc etc.The Islamic movement at that time was a horrible and barbaric movement. The knights templars were instructed to destroy this barbaric movement and reclaim Christian towns and nations.The Islamic movement were not victims as this documentary paints it out to be, but rather they themselves were the largely the aggressors for hundreds of years.Secondly, the narrative displayed in this documentary that the crusaders committed war crimes and killed indiscriminately. Simply not true.Firstly, what we would constitute now days as war crimes were extremely different to how that would have looked like 1000 years ago. Secondly, there is absolutely no primary source of evidence that gives merit that the templars killed women and children, fellow Christians or otherwise. These are fable stories passed down from generation to generation and heavily reliant on the confession of the last templar master under extreme torture to which he later recanted as he was about to be killed.There is so much more I could write and include here however in closing if you decide to watch this documentary, try to see it with out the bias narrative of the narrators and so called specialists.",

In Korea many women leave because the discriminator they have to deal with because they do not want to live the type of traditional life they feel pressured to live, and the men are finding wives from the Philippines. Men from the Faroes Islands are also finding wives from the Philippines. In the US women will no longer just stay in a relationship, and so often seem to prefer being single to dealing with a male partner. And so many of the American men are lost in how they find a girlfriend. The result is that the US is becoming a single. Japan is also struggling, and probably more so than the US because of the even greater isolation between the sexes. It is even harder for Japanese to relate to the other sex, and with disappearance of arranged marriages they are lost. One of the interesting sections of this documentary is how a French man runs a club where the Japanese girls can meet foreign men, and there are a lot of marriages out of it. There are also men that a woman can pay to have a simple date with them, and they show a case where the rented man is helping the woman interact with men. There are the Japanese boys that now live their lives in virtual realities with and find the virtual girls more what they want. How is the world going to deal with the changes? Whether this documentary actually is a good representation of Japanese love life I cannot say, which is why I rated it an 8.",

You're willing to sacrifice 20 thousand people in another country just so you can go to a Wings concert. You sacrifice the lives of a hundred thousand Chinese female babies just so you can rent this f'ing camera and do your stupid art project. No problem! You're a piece of shit. Once you realize you're a piece of shit it's not so hard to take. Because then you don't have this feeling that you're a good person all the time. And let me tell you something, feeling that you're a good person all the time is like having a brand new car with no scratches on it. It's a real responsibility which is almost impossible to live up to. Being a piece of shit and then occasionally doing something that's good and true is a much easier place to be. I think that's really important and I always try to raise my kids to understand that they're not that terrific. And that not being that terrific, that's okay 'cause most people who say that they're terrific, Bill Clinton, Cardinal Egan, anybody you want to talk about, they're not so terrific. Martha Stewart, they're not so fucking terrific either. And there's nothing wrong with being not-so-terrific.

And what if the bands you listen to were heavily influenced by this mystery band ... and may have even sampled their work in songs? Tim MacKenzie-Smith profiles \"the greatest band you've never heard of\" with this documentary on the 1970's British funk band, Cymande.Where are they from? Where did they go? Why weren't they more successful? All good questions that MacKenzie-Smith tackles with help from Cymande superfans like producer Mark Ronson and My Morning Jacket's Jim Jones, the latter who describes his love of the Fugees \"The Score\" in which they sample Cymande's \"Dove\". It's this and other examples that allow us to discover the band's influence on the beginning stages of hip-hop. It also helps makes sense of an included quote, \"some music is bigger than music.\"\nWith most early band members hailing from the West Indies, they were never accepted in the U. K., and discrimination and racism clearly played a part in blocking their success. The band did find more popularity in the U. S. thanks to their fresh and original music, but one of the band members admit they were beaten down by the system. MacKenzie-Smith includes many interviews with band members, most of whom are now in their 70's. They come across as likable guys carrying almost no bitterness.Of course, Cymande should be well-known for their contributions and influence over the years, and the film features much of their music, as well as clips from live performances. It's a smooth groove with a fantastic bass line, and it's the music itself that helps us understand how it contributed to club and dance music of the 1980's and 90's. The film made the festival rounds in 2022 and is now getting a limited theatrical release in conjunction with the band re-forming and touring. Perhaps that lucky break is finally happening all these years later, but regardless, these guys will be playing music ... as it should be.",

Too Lackluster. She needs to Drastically Improve.🤷 Giselle - Terrible Dancer, just terrible. The Casting of Aespa could of literally went on to the Street and got anyone for the 4th spot. She needs vast amounts of Dance and Routine training.Beyonce and Taylor Swift go Full Force in their Live Performances and I understand that this is a Girl group of 4, so it's even harder.So here's what to do -💃First of all, Ningning & Giselle need to Drastically improve their bodily Movement, it was lackluster as hell at times. Just terrible. They need Sharp and Strong Movements like Karina, not Lackluster and weak as hell movements.🔀 Also, change up the routines, have 2 girls do one routine simultaneously, and have the other 2 girls do another routine simultaneously.🔃 Start getting some new and better moves too. Some of the moves were generic as hell.It got so bad that the Backup Dancers were better than 2 of the Girls.1 Positive, The Stage Backgrounds looked Great, and some of their Best Songs were great to hear, especially my favourite song of theirs \"Next Level\".Overall, this film was nowhere Near Beyonce and Taylor Swifts Films.",

            "storyline": "The movie intended to be a dystopian fable of Bolsonaro's Brazil with its militarism, fake patriotic defense, widespread charismatic Christianity, and impoverishment of people. However, the excessive long length and terrible pace make it a failure, and the script tries many things without reaching any cohesion. There is the intention of putting peripheric (and formerly in jail) lesbian black women as protagonists in a naturalistic aesthetics such as the recurrent one in films from Contagem, but the script is bad and the references are fragrant and not sophisticated. The grimy aesthetics in a slum in Ceilândia (near Brasília) in the very beginning seemed promising but soon the terrible pace became an obvious constraint. The first 14 minutes could have been two! Together with a lack of events, there is a boring testimony in a documentary style in order to compensate the impossibility of understanding what is going on simply by watching the scenes. After the title of the movie appears, situation does not change for nearly one hour and a half. Almost nothing happen, and pace is sluggish as hell. There are many boring or annoying scenes intending to show that atmosphere, but they are often too long (and recurrently with long bad music). The most remarkable was the bizarre 8-minute charismatic worship ceremony scene, a penalty I believe that spectator did not deserve. The supposedly main plot of the former convict women who composed a gang of oil theft and smuggling is very badly connected with the elections, in which one of the characters is a candidate of fictional Party of the Arrested People, with a platform with many issues directed toward the rights of the poor people. Only when one hour and a half length is over, the references to Bolsonaro's Brazil appear, including explicit mentions to him, in the mouths and T-shirts of his (in the film, always white) supporters. In the radio, it is mentioned (with bad sound) that the regime opposed \"criminals and subversives\", like in military dictatorship. Policemen use Bolsonaro's slogan as theirs; nothing is subtle in the movie. We also see that the women gang becomes increasingly partner of motorcycle delivery men, who suffer with job insecurity of (also a core issue in nowadays world). Uninteresting naturalistic long dialogues (on lesbian sexuality, life in jail, dysfunctional family background, and so forth), emulating a documentary, occupy a long fraction of the movie throughout it, contributing for its tediousness. To resume, this movie with more than 2 hours and a half length would work better if it were not only shorter, but actually a short film. There is too much time for too little to show. The long dialogues of women who look like belonging to the poor people do not make the film be truer or deeper.",

            "storyline": "Saw this movie last night. WOW! A lot of Christian movies are not very well made unfortunately, but I have to say as a filmmaker myself, this is one of the best Christian movies I have seen to date.Firstly, the production is top notch. It is filmed, edited and produced expertly. It kept me interested and was never boring. The last Christian movie I say was from a well known Christian band and I was itching for it to be over after 30mins. I could have watched this for another hour though. While it was pretty much delivered like a documentary with Nik telling the stories of his life as a missionary in some of the worst places on the planet, I never once was board. Using real photos, some video and also re-enactments of the stories, it was engrossing in every way. It was also very hard hitting and brought me to tears on many occasions. Personally when I watch a movie I look for the emotions that the movie brings. Even a beautifully shot movie can have no emotion and while I will give it props for being shot well (See Arrival), if there is no emotional connection with the store or the characters, I won't score it high. The \"Insanity of God\" brought the emotion, from complete and utter sadness, to overwhelming joy. This movie has it all. On the spiritual side of things, you also walk away taking stock of your life and how you live, you cannot help but not think about what you just saw and heard and it will leave a lasting impression on you. It really is that powerful.",

He embraces his duties and goes above and beyond to make this difficult time a more comfortable and compassionate one. Aside from all of this, I found the \"nuts and bolts\" of some of the process very interesting. Also, the amount of time he spends \"behind the scenes\" as funeral director is something the general public would not have any idea about; I found this to be an interesting and heartfelt film.",

But, he did break into people's homes, which can be enough to unseat the feeling of safety in their own place. The presentation of this barefoot bandit's feats is well paced. I found this flick riveting, even the music parts are interesting. Colton broke out of his group home where he lived after his stint in juvie, and melted into the woods. He's all over cctv, when he wants to be. He steals cars, breaks into homes, steals boats, steals computers so he can have stuff sent to the very homes he stole from. Steals the stuff, learns to fly from the stuff, and then...he steals planes. He flies wherever he feels like it. How could he not become an antihero. It's an American recipe.",

They are talking about kids in this movie being tricked by adults ! Really do you think teenagers and or pre-teens want to service an old fat men for $30? And then hand over the money? And to do this morning, noon and night? Do you think children are just as smart as an adult? Do you think a child's brain is fully developed? Do you think a child has sharpened critical thinking skills. Do you think adults can manipulate a child's mind and threaten them with violence to them and or to their families to control them? You do realized a human's brain isn't fully developed until 25 right. Do you know when you capture an elephant you need to only chain it up for a few weeks and after unsuccessfully trying to break the chain it can be secured with a rope for the rest of it's life.

            "storyline": "The fact that Hex followers have often been described as a cult and that almost every review of this film has rated it a ten, should tell you everything you need to know about the reviewers. There is currently only one review out of over fifty that rates this film as less than a ten and that's at an eight. There are very few films that really deserve a ten rating. Any film that has anything to say will have some people who love it and some who hate it. So it's pretty obvious the ratings are being manipulated and that it's really just a ninety minute infomercial for Hex.The film consists mostly of talking heads hype people for Hex who call themselves Hexicans including the scam leader himself Richard Heart bragging about not only Hex, but his big dick, cars, high IQ, ability to predict the future, and world's largest diamond. You'll see other reviews claim the film is balanced because they interview one couple who lost money in comparison to all the others, some of whom are hyping Hex and PulseChain even though they lost money as well. That's not what any normal person would consider balanced.In addition, there's several scenes about midway through that look completely staged. One where Heart is supposedly at a meetup in Denmark at which people in the audience asking questions and they cut back and forth to Heart in front of a red curtain answering questions. The lighting and sound give the impression these weren't even filmed at the same time in the same room, as if the questions were filmed and then Heart was filmed later after he thought up cute funny answers. Cue the canned laughter. Then there's another scene with Heart at what appears to be an estate surrounded by blonde debutante investors drinking wine and dancing with hula girls while making his pitch. No explanation of who these rich blond potential investors are is ever made.Without any spoilers to how the film itself ends, it's pretty easy to look up on the internet how Hex and PulseChain are doing now. Hex reached its height in Sept 2021 at .478 and is currently, at time of this review, at .0005 and Pulsechain has been at zero since May. Richard Heart is currently being sued by the SEC.I truly hope no one reading the reviews here or watching the film gets taken in by the hype.",

Jodhpur, Nargaon, Kolkata, Birgunj, Dinanagar, and Imphal.The way he has narrated the entire documentary is involving and creates a deeper impact on your mind. At the end of the film, I as an audience was very much attached to every person and their life. It makes you think of our society, human nature, reality, and our responsibility towards our nation. Very thoughtful!Before I conclude my thoughts on this documentary the song \"AAMI TOMAKE\" by Laurie Kallevig and Survivor girl Ukulele band is magical! This gives you joy and tears at the same time. Using it, in the end, was an excellent idea!Congratulations on this documentary, Samarth! Looking forward to seeing your upcoming works. Best wishes!",

            "storyline": "I would say the movie itself isn't anything too special. I went in expecting to learn much about Shulgin, and his series of books: Pihkal and Tihkal. Perhaps more in-depth information about how Sasha and Ann synthesize their different analogs and homologues, their experiences with these substances, and info on how the family live their lives. The last one was fulfilled to some extent, but much of this movie gave me a sense of Deja Vu because I had seen some of the clips used in it on Youtube and such. However, this is not a failure, because while it doesn't focus on the things that a viewer might expect them to (this movie attracts a very rare breed, and the showings are very exclusive), it does show what some people don't expect: the lives of a happy, normal, successful family. No matter how many drugs Shulgin has invented for people to eat, snort, shoot, this film makes you realize that this man's only intention is to figure out the mind, and he's very careful (if a bit humorously absent-minded) with his creations. You can sense the love and life between the characters, they are simply normal people, and much of the movie shows the more mundane parts of their lives, albeit in a humorous way.Its sad that his chemical formulas for things like mescaline and DMT derivatives are considered by many to be \"Dirty Pictures\", when really they are some of the only paths straight into the mind (not the brain, as Shulgin explains himself)Don't get me wrong, its not that there wasn't enough detail on drug use (but it sort of is), and there is plenty of humor (although it is subtle) in this documentary, definitely more than I expected. Shulgin is juxtaposed with his son, who collects rare tools (unlike the \"tools\" Shulgin makes, these are tools in the most traditional way), and a DEA agent. Lots of filler as people ride in trains (this is symbolic of Shulgin's first MDMA trip as is explained in the movie, but it was overused if you ask me) Maybe its just that I'd like to know more about HOW Shulgin started manipulating chemical formulas to make 2c-b and created a whole series of famous 2c-based drugs, or his experiments with countless other hallucinogens, how he got DEA approval, more detail on his struggles with the DEA, since this information is basically nowhere to be found, besides maybe snippets of P/Tihkal.On the other hand, its interesting to find out about his rebellious son, the way he and Ann go through the day, seeing the lab in person and hearing people being interviewed on their opinions and relation to Sasha Shulgin.For a movie so exclusive, you would just expect more detail on the \"low key\" aspects of his life. I was fully prepared to hear psychedelic formulas and experience reports throughout the whole movie, only to find out this wasn't the case. Not a tragedy, but I wish the director had taken that route at least a *bit* more",

I myself, assumed that this was about women who wanted to be been. I guess that's why I didn't watch it for a long time. Needless to say, I was wrong. People automatically assume that lesbians that have more male like ways want to be men, which isn't the case. One girl who identified herself as \"aggressive\" stated that\"... if you're considered to be 'aggressive' in the lesbian community, you have to butch it up a little to compete with the other 'aggressives'.\" I thought about this and came to the conclusion that everyone, especially in our society competes with the next, women do so with other women to attract men, people compete for jobs, raises and so forth. So I guess it is only natural for \"aggressive\" women in the lesbian community to compete with each other in order for them to survive among their peers they have to. Another twist on evolution I guess or adaption rather...Just my thoughts",

Much of the dialogue is spoken in Spanish with subtitles added when English is spoken on the screen. As a result, you will get more out of this documentary if you are able to understand the Spanish audio. The documentary includes visits to various porn sets where the viewer can see Rebeca's interpersonal history with her co-workers. One of these co-workers is Macro Bandares who like Rebeca resided in Spain before coming to the United States to work in the porn industry. I believe the documentary begins filming around February 2007 and concludes around January 2009. During January 2009, much of the footage revolves around Rebeca preparing to attend the AVN Awards in Las Vegas. I found the documentary very insightful in seeing the interpersonal reactions that Rebeca emotionally shows off on the screen. The only complaint I might have is that it could had been longer than 46 minutes but I take what is given by the creator of this documentary",

A few enlightened administrations have realised their folly and relaxed their grip. The thing is - it's not about 'drugs' as such, it about what the state is unable to control And that, Dear Reader, is the crux of the matter and the crux of the movie.One of the best lines in the movie is: \"If laws are wrong we have to break them!\". There are so many laws today which are wrong from so many viewpoints and on so many levels with so-called 'law-makers' justifying their decisions to restrict freedom and limit control in the name of whatever-they-deem-politically-suitable-at-the-time. Make no mistake - it's about controlling you, very little else.Everyone needs to step up to the plate and not roll over when Big Brother makes a new decress.Well, that was a rant, wasn't it...?",

The basic premise that Carra (the expedition leader) works from, is that Amelia and Noonan always intended that after flying some hours, and a couple thousand miles, and \"not seeing the island\" (Howard Island) at first were not-to-ditch the aircraft and sink themselves, but rather to just turn-around to Papua, land, and try again. But alas, they crashed there in Papau. All other expeditions have been focused out at sea near Howard Island. And further to have first-hand evidence of a plane with Amelia's engine serial numbers in the jungle -- well, why not just focus there? But read \"Savage Harvest\" perhaps before this film docu and you'll see why getting answers out of this dark hole of unanswered questions is the last place on earth that anyone should have to look, for anyone or anything (whether Michael Rockefeller or Amelia Earhart or Fred Noonan or their plane) That jungle area makes the Bermuda Triangle look like a brightly lit room, compared to the shadowy abyss of the New Guinea jungles.

I hope every comedian is watching and taking notes, because if Dave Attell is still doing it - then the bar is finally getting raised back up.I missed funny. Every sentence in these 37 minutes of comedy gold is a one-liner. And there's plenty of non-scripted ones either.

I learnt more about the iconic song, You're the Voice' and other great songs he performed. It was so interesting to see how he became a young sensation with 'Sadie The Cleaning Lady' but this sadly held him back for almost two decades. People have long memories in the music business. It was beautiful seeing the strong enduring friendships he made that helped him succeed. It was also wonderful seeing the historical context and other greats who featured during his journey.

What we have here is a truly stunning documentary that somehow, with no Karen Dalton to interview, gives us a very complete portrait of a complex and brilliant artist.Using singer Angel Olsen to bring Dalton's poetry to life is a stroke of genius. The people in her life who tell her story, are honest and caring. The look of the film, as if it were found in some old box that had been sitting on a closet shelf for 5 decades perfectly matches the tone, the subject. And the live performances of Dalton that they have managed to find will take your breath away.As someone who has made 5 (going on 6) music documentaries, I tend to be very hard on them. But IN MY OWN TIME was very easy to fall in love with. Like it's subject's voice, it is damn near perfect.(Saw this at DOC NYC 2020 film festival.)",

This is not a story about thieves or missing tubas. Instead, it asks what it means to listen. The film consist mainly dialogue from subtitles as many of the characters were communicating done from sign language which was an interesting way on communicating the film.However, I didn't really know what the film really wants to be. There are good aspects of camerawork, production, and normal interactions between the participants. But I am not really sure what was the impact of the story trying to be and what the film is wanting to be. I feel like this film is too experimental for me.Good camerawork but I wouldn't see it again quickly.Rating: C+",

            "storyline": "After the planes hit on 9/11, Morgan Stanley security chief Rick Rescorla put into effect plans that he had developed years before. Rick had seen the potential for an airborne suicide attack on the twin towers as part of evaluating the risk posed to his wards within their building. After the attack in 1993 Rick took it personally to prepare and avoid the chaotic scenes that came with the 93 attack. This documentary tells the story of the man who predicted the 9/11 attacks and saved thousands of lives and died in the process.Although it was notable in the UK that the 4th anniversary of 9/11 came and went with comparatively little fuss, it did mean that this film got screened as one of several \"different\" documentaries about the attack. Before watching this film the only thing I knew about Rescorla was a small note in a paper shortly after the event that Hollywood was looking to make a film about a Cornish man who had saved lives during the attack. However I watched this documentary enthralled by the life of this professional man who had simply and heroically done his job and had saved thousands in the process. The film spends a little time looking back at his life but unsurprisingly the focus is 9/11. The second half surprised me because I thought I would be jaded by the footage of 9/11 by now, but I wasn't  it was still as impacting and as unbelievable as it was the very first time I saw it. Within this the film talks to the staff from Morgan Stanley who all talk about what happened and share their memories of Rescorla's actions. The story they tell of that day is enthralling and it is consistently engaging  it is a simple story of heroics and it is fascinating as such.The talking heads are all pretty good and are edited together well to paint the picture while the narration is level and helps the film avoid becoming sentimental. Overall this is a great documentary that tells one story of thousands of 9/11. It tells Rescorla's story in a level and balanced way that is free of sentiment and a very good testament to the simple, unassuming heroics of one man and much better than I imagine any dramatised version could do it.",

He organized to get the children out which attracted the attention of a beautiful German spy. He was rejected by every country except his own, Britain. In the process, he lost his job. With guile, persistence, and forged papers, he was able to rescue 669 children. For 50 years, the story had been forgotten until his wife found a curious book in the attic.The story is amazing. It's a relatively standard news documentary. However if you don't shed at least one tear, you better have your heart checked.",

Things you would never have occasion to observe as a tourist, but which are obviously all around you, just under the surface. Those scenes alone make the film worth seeing, if you're interested in Iran. Apart from that, the narrative is a little shallow. Nothing much happens besides the tedious process of two young DJ's trying to make it out of Iran. Many people will probably find the film dull, especially those who go to see it for the music or club angle. I would have appreciated it if the director had been more forthright about why and how the film was made. Put herself into the picture a little more. Yet, for a first film, this is a very good piece of work. Hope to see more from her.",

            "storyline": "As I mentioned in my review of the PBS documentary \"Tulsa: The Fire and the Forgotten\" (2021), \"Dreamland: The Burning of Black Wall Street\" is one in a slew of such TV and streaming commemorations of the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This one stands out because it recognizes rather reflexively the power of storytelling and particularly cinematic storytelling for the history of the massacre and the depiction of race in the United States overall. It's in the title: Dreamland being the name of the movie theatre in the Greenwood district of Tulsa--one of the many building to be burned to rubble amidst the attack from a white mob upon the black part of the segregated city. It's the same theatre featured prominently in the HBO \"Watchmen\" (2019) series. The dramatization in this documentary isn't quite as exciting as in that superhero saga, but I did appreciate the use of limited animation to stylistically recreate the massacre. Past video interviews of the survivors aren't merely shown without context of their creation, either, as we also see some discussion of their making.There's also the media from the era of the massacre. This includes the city's newspapers inciting racial animus (although Greenwood's black-owned paper doesn't receive the attention here that it does in the History Channel documentary, \"Tulsa Burning: The 1921 Race Massacre\" (2021)). And, cinematically, this includes, of course, that most notorious of racist epics, \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915). Note that the elevator incident cited as instigating the massacre is the same trope of black men raping white women that was the central theme underpinning the narrative of D. W. Griffith's film. So, that's an apt connection made in this documentary. It's also pointed out that the KKK often serves as a boogeyman in consideration of such tragedies, but racism has been much more prevalent than that--even though some of the Tulsa police force and presumably some of the terrorists were Klansmen.The History Channel and PBS docs do better in some regards to discussing the culpabilities of Tulsa and Oklahoma governments for the massacre, but this one, too, goes into the blaming afterwards and internment of the newly-homeless African-American survivors. Moreover, the depiction of a white mob gunning down black people, setting their homes and businesses ablaze and even fire bombing Greenwood from airplanes over 16 hours on Memorial Day weekend leaves no doubt as to whether it could've happened without the support of government, the local police and fire services and, later, the National Guard. The picture does well to discuss the origins of Greenwood and its continuation after the massacre, as well, including the ultimate destruction of the neighborhood by so-called \"urban renewal,\" later in the 20th century that removed residents from their homes and destroyed their businesses. Appropriately enough, the documentary investigates newsreels and photographs depicting these events with varying degrees of bias, too. At least, now, attention is being brought to the massacre by media, including with these documentaries.",

            "storyline": "Starting with the legalisation of gay sex in private for adults over 21 years old this film moves quickly through the history of male homosexuality in the UK. Looking at the wider impact on society it covers the reduction of the age of consent, the first gay characters in sitcoms right through to the modern events of gaydar.com and civil partnerships.The title alone suggests that this is not going to be a gentle documentary that takes a softly-softly approach to the increasing acceptance of male homosexuality  suffice to say that the content has no interest in pandering to those that still would be repulsed by two men kissing (which, lets be honest is still a huge amount of people). At times this is its downside because it does throw garish images onto the screen with abandon and perhaps has details that are too specific considering the breath of the topic it is trying to cover. It did suggest to me a certain amount of homophobe-baiting, understandable perhaps but it doesn't strengthen the film.Fortunately the rest of the film is quite strong even for the casual straight viewer such as myself. The contributors are perhaps not the tightest or more exclusive group but they are well used and edited to be concise and meaningful while still being personal. The odd contributor proves themselves the exception to the rule but mostly it is all good. Like any potted history of any subject, the film struggles to have a lot of debate or detail and it is fair to suggest that this is a weakness of the documentary  that it rattles forward covering ground without perhaps having a lot of food for thought, but it is hard to criticise it for this because this is also a strength.Overall then, an interesting potted history across the last forty years of male homosexuality in the UK. Superficial perhaps but engaging for what it is and sat well as part of Channel 4's \"40 Years Out\" season of films (that provided the detail and debate that this lacked).",

This doco has at least got cooperation and involvement from the police, but presents it in such a way that is in itself unfair - while the police's actions are undoubtedly heavy handed, it is not unfounded since they are dealing with criminals. Bringing the race argument into the discussion also seems unnecessary, and just distracts from the narrative.In the end, it's a compelling story, told well but mostly from one perspective.

It's kind of like an extended 'interview' with Matt (except that the camera simply watches what's happening while Matt interacts with his local customers, works with books, orders books, talks about books, recommends books, and sometimes just quietly ruminates on life the universe and everything). It's all very enjoyable in a low-key way.The director (A. B. Zax, whom I know nothing about -- is this a pseudonym?) must have shot a lot of film and then lots of editing down and selecting how to put scenes in some kind of order. The result is little or no order at all. The effect is to encourage you to just sit back and let things flow past. If there's a greater message, I guess it's just that Matt stands in for any long-time self-employed business person who loves what he's doing so much that he just can't imagine doing anything else. And his devoted local customers obviously feel the same way.Fun film. Nothing major, but personable and captivating.",

The show claims they use satellite footages to recreate Mars - it wasn't impressive - the CGI are rather poor and perhaps fake. The top-down image are real but the others were re-created from these so they are not 100% correct and just look lousy. Not as \"amazing\" as they keep telling you.As for the Rover story, it takes maybe 5 minutes screentime. It's still probably the best part but nothing new. Instead one should find a documentary on Opportunity Rover. It's almost sad it stayed up there 14 years and eventually broke. If you children saw WALL-E they will see a connection.In the end \"One Day\" has nothing to do with the show either, they just place an hour timer in-between sequences that are unrelated to anything.

As a big fan of Tendergrass, it was truly a great experience to watch this heartwarming documentary that fully shows how great he was. And sad to think of how the career could progress. But as this movie shows, Pendergrass found his inner strength and continued his career and continued to succeed.\nThe documentary also shows social problems and racism Pedergrass had to deal with, nevertheless he found his place in a very tough industry, and succeeded.\nThe strength of the documentary is that there are those who were really fond of Pendergrass contributing here, and that makes it both real, credible and enlightening. And told from the heart, honest and true. And best of all; here are lots of Teddy Pendergrass's great music. If you want to watch a documentary, choose this one!",

            "storyline": "This documentary premiered at the last edition of the Venice Film Festival and introduces us to Hayao Miyazaki like never before. Hayao, founder of Studio Ghibli, has been transporting us to unique universes with his films for over 50 years. My Neighbor Tororo, Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke are the top ten of his films, which have already become cult classics. Thanks to privileged access to his work and interviews with his son, director Goro Miyazaki, and with Toshio Suzuki, producer and friend of Hayao, we discover the life, cinema and influences of the director. In fact, In 2014, Miyazaki was awarded an Honorary Academy Award for his impact on animation and cinema.Miyazaki's early work was as a mangaka, when Hayao first saw the film The Panda and the Magic Serpent, he made the decision to dedicate himself to film animation. His first film was Panda and Friends, made with his usual collaborator Takahata. And he worked for the powerful Toei film company , working in Horus: Prince of the Sun (1968), a precursor to the ' Shónen style' in anime (Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto), its then revolutionary ideas were copied and perfected to the point of exhaustion in the most popular series and films of the genre. Surrounded by a young and ambitious team led by the then unknown and newcomer Hayao Miyazaki, he provided the set design and ideological support for much of this film. But this was a time of student revolt and strikes and director Takahata and Miyazaki (future founders of Studio Ghibli who met here for the first time) were idealists with left-wing convictions at the time. This caused a strong clash with Toei, since the working conditions were precarious and exhausting. His next film was ¨The Castle of Cagliostro¨, which was a commercial failure, however today it is a highly revered film and a cult film. Due to the previous failure, Hayao became a mangaka again, drawing the manga series, Nausicaa. Due to its success, he continued with the film adaptation: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984). He founded Ghibli Studios with his partner, friend and long-time collaborator Takahata. Since then, he has since directed, written, and produced many other films with Isao Takahata. More recently, he has produced with Toshio Suzuki. All enjoyed critical and box office success, in particular Princess Mononoke (1997). It received the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about USD $150 million) domestic film in Japan's history at the time of its release.In addition to animation, he also draws manga. His major work was Nausicaä, an epic tale he worked on intermittently from 1982 to 1984 while he was busy making animated films. Another manga Hikotei Jidai, later evolved into Porco Rosso (1992). Other important animes were : Castle in the Sky (1986), Ponyo (2008) , Tales from Earthsea (2006) along with his son Goro Miyazaki, and, of course, his masterpiece Spirited away (2001).The documentary is very instructive, thanks to it we learn the main keys to Hayao's work: his interest in the environment, ecology, natural and man-made disasters, environment, climate change, Japanese religion as Shintoism, Animism , spiritual beings like the Camy, etc. He was born during the Second World War, and suffered the consequences as a child, being very worried due to his mother's tuberculosis. We learn of his interest in aviation because his relatives worked in aircraft manufacturing, especially he loved the iconic plane in his films, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, which operated in WWII. As well as his fondness for vegetation and trees such as the camphor tree, especially the one located in Nagoya.",

Now, I'm a big fan of motor racing in general and F1 in particular and when I was made aware of this docu I had to give it a try despite the low rating. I'm glad I did because there's NO WAY this show should rank so low. It's well made and paced nicely. It's informant and more importantly, entertaining. Makes me wonder about all the 1 ratings. In a case like this it reeks of overkill for those who dislike Hamilton personally. What Hamilton has achieved is absolutely ground breaking and I can't wait to see what else he can accomplish.",

Well, for them it's not complicated, for a girl that is an ass virgin, today it's anal or a double, tomorrow it's a double anal, and the next day if they can, they get three up her ass. No girl in the world could take three cocks up her ass if she's never had anal sex before. There's no way. There is a way to do it, that's to give her two of the little pills they use for childbirth to relax the muscles and then we inject a kilo of Lidocaine in her arse so she won't feel anything. Since the guys have had their cocks injected or are doped up, they don't care, because if you use anesthetics, your cock will stay soft. But with injections it remains hard. So they destroy the girls. The girls will have to go to hospital, her ass will hurt and she won't want to work anymore. She's become like exclusive. Those people deserve to be shot.

Sapienza approached her and she got a hold of her family along with their former Centralia neighbors and met the crew out in Centralia to film four interviews in April 2014.

Incisive observations from Carla Bley and Ornette Coleman regarding the hardships the musicians endured, as well as why they chose this difficult path, but expressed in non-academic terms.The performance excerpts are well chosen (especially the Albert Ayler piece) and should whet listeners' appetites for more.

Herbicide Resisters are immune to weed killer, like round up ready. The herbicide is inserted into the plant DNA to make it resistant to round up. The very beginnings of agriculture started 10,000 years ago. Around 900AD, the chinese started using arsenic sulfides in their planting. In 1945, 200 million pounds of pesticides were used. By 2000, it was 5.1 billion pounds of pesticides. Now over 500 species of bugs are resistant to pesticides. After 30 years of side by side comparisons b/n organic and chemical agriculture, the rod ale farming systems trial proved that organic yields match conventional yields. Organic corn yields were 31% higher than convention in years of drought. Conventional systems emit nearly 40% more greenhouse gases per pound of crop produces that the organic systems. Organic fields increase groundwater recharge and reduce runoff. 60 countries require the labeling of GMOS, and we can't even get 1 single state due to Monsanto. 6 million people in California voted for prop 37 to label GMOs but the industry paid 45 million dollars to make sure it wouldn't pass. in 1992 under heavy pressure from the biotech industry, the FDA declared that GMOs were generally recognized as safe. GRASS. There's something extremely wrong when the government becomes captive to a single industry and pushes non-renewal, debt creating seeds that destroy bio diversity.

Twenty years after a lot of people who were involved were willing to talk about that Sunday twenty years ago, when about 40 English popstars came together, and recorded this little 'hymne' for the starving people in Africa.You get to see how Bob Geldof came up with the idea (sitting on his couch with his daughters, watching the news, seeing thousands of children die in Africa), how he subsequently got together with Midge Ure to write a song, and how the recording process was. The latter is definitely the better piece of the documentary with some fantastic footage of all those 80's popstar heroes. Check out the guys from Status Quo, you'll laugh your ass of. It concludes with the question 'was it all worth it?', 'did the money went where it was supposed to go?', and we can actually see that it made a bit of a difference..I was twelve years old when Live Aid happened that Friday in June and I spent about twenty hours in front of the TV, totally mesmerized.

It was realized to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the most incredible journey by sea ever made. A nice and spectacular documentary , this ¨El viaje más largo (2020)¨ or ¨The Longest Journey¨ mixes animation, interviews with experts , prestigious historians, and images at the time by taking a look at humanity's journey into the unknown, focusing on two different eras with a common human and technological challenge.El viaje más largo (2020) is an enjoyable and attractive documentary that presents us a lot of biographic elements about Fernando de Magallanes and Juan Sebastián Elcano . Focusing on the deeds of the Portuguese Magellan and the Spanish Elcano between 1519 and 1522, when the former commanded a flotilla of ships armed by the Crown of Spain in search of an alternative way to the Asian land route , passing the Magellan strait , arriving to Guam , Marianas islands , to reach the Moluccas Islands and establish a maritime trade route bordering America to the south, and the second, Elcano, completed the feat after the death of the Portuguese in what are now the Philippine Islands, in the island of Cebú while he combated rebel natives . Secondly, but obviously associated with the first, the film shows the analogies between that first circumnavigation trip around the world with the space race and, specifically, with the arrival of the first man on the Moon in 1969, concluding that space is the new ocean that the human being tends to explore, something that is in the very essence of homo sapiens, the curiosity to find new lands, new spaces, new frontiers, physical or intellectual.Produced by La Claqueta, and Dibulitoon Studio that also made the cartoon movie ¨Elcano y Magallanes. La primera vuelta al mundo (2019)¨. This documentary was well made by Manuel H. Martín (Huelva, 1980) who takes up the formula he used in 30 Years of Darkness . He is an Andalusian director and producer who already has an appreciable career in cinema. To him is due, for example, the intertwined animated documentary 30 years of darkness (2012), about the so-called \"moles\" of the Civil War (men who remained locked up for decades, in order to escape the summary justice of Francoism), very appreciated and awarded, which turned out to be the germ of The Infinite Trench (2019) or La Trinchera Infinita , the brand new Basque-Andalusian film nominated this year for the Oscar on behalf of Spain.Adding more historical remarks to those depicted on the movie , these are the following ones : Magallanes was a Portuguese explorer and a subject of the Hispanic Monarchy from 1518. He is best known for having planned and led the 1519 Spanish expedition to the East Indies across the Pacific Ocean to open a maritime trade route, during which he discovered the interoceanic passage bearing thereafter his name and achieved the first European navigation from the Atlantic to Asia. During this voyage, Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in 1521 in the present-day Philippines, after running into resistance by the indigenous population led by Lapulapu, who consequently became a Philippines national symbol of resistance to colonialism. After Magellan's death, Juan Sebastián Elcano took the lead of the expedition, and with its few other surviving members, in one of the two remaining ships, completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth when they returned to Spain in 1522. Born 4 February 1480 into a family of minor Portuguese nobility, Magellan became a skilled sailor and naval officer in service of the Portuguese Crown in Asia. King Manuel I of Portugal refused to support Magellan's plan to reach the Maluku Islands (the \"Spice Islands\") by sailing westwards around the American continent. Facing some criminal offences, Magellan left Portugal and proposed the same expedition to King Charles I of Spain, who accepted it. Consequently, many in Portugal considered him a traitor and he never returned. In Seville, he married, fathered two children, and organised the expedition. Granted special powers and privileges by the King, he led the Armada from Sanlucar de Barrameda, southwest across the Atlantic Ocean, to the eastern coast of South America, and down to Patagonia. Despite a series of storms and mutinies, the expedition successfully passed through the Strait of Magellan into the Mar del Sur, which Magellan renamed the \"Peaceful Sea\" . The expedition reached Guam and, shortly after, the Philippine islands. There Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in April 1521. Under the command of captain Juan Sebastian Elcano, the expedition later reached the Spice Islands. To navigate back to Spain and avoid seizure by the Portuguese, the expedition's two remaining ships split, one attempting, unsuccessfully, to reach New Spain by sailing eastwards across the Pacific, while the other, commanded by Elcano, sailed westwards via the Indian Ocean and up the Atlantic coast of Africa, finally arriving at the expedition's port of departure and thereby completing the first complete circuit of the globe. While in the Kingdom of Portugal's service, Magellan had already reached the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia on previous voyages traveling east (from 1505 to 1511-1512). By visiting this area again but now traveling west, Magellan achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.",

            "storyline": "Produced in association with two Hollywood producers, whose credits include RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY (2016), JAMES ELLROY'S LA (2011), and OUT OF Egypt (2009), this is a big-budget documentary focusing on the Hittite civilizations with a cast of Turkish stars including Haluk Bilginer, Fikret Kuşkan and Sanem Çelik.Narrated by Jeremy Irons (in English) and Cüneyt Türel (in Turkish), Tolga Örnek's film traces the growth and development of a people whose empire once covered most of the Middle East. Through a combination of re-enactment, CGI effects, expert testimonies and shots of ancient artifacts, the film tells the story of a series of kings, both weak and strong, who were responsible for the contraction and the expansion of Empire. The best kings were often despotic in attitude, but they knew how to manage an army as well as initiate the best military tactics to ensure victory. They also spent money on fortifying their major cities, notably at Hattuşa in Central Anatolia (the remains of which can still be seen near the village of Boğazköy).Örnek's film stresses the beneficial aspects of Hittite rule: its emphasis on the rule of law where justice was meted out fairly with the punishment suiting the crime; the emphasis on preserving social harmony through the provision of well-designed cities (even though they were rigidly socially stratified); the importance of religion, especially the worship of several gods who both sanctioned and censured human activity; and the power of myth, which not only held Hittite society together but helped law the foundations for the mythologies of later nations such as the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Hittite cultures were very absorbent; whenever they conquered a nation, they often appropriated its gods rather than trying to impose their religion on others. It was this quality that helped give rise to so many different mythologies once the Hittite race had died out.HITITLER also emphasizes the race's military and diplomatic abilities. They held on to power for centuries as a result of skillful planning, as well as maintaining a tough regime where soldiers were expected to conform to certain preset masculine ideals. On the other hand the Hittites were also responsible for the first major military treaty, which they signed with the Pharoah Rameses II of Egypt following the Battle of Kadesh. They understood that global peace could be sustained by peaceful as well as aggressive means.Ideologically speaking, Örnek's film follows his previous documentary on Mount Nemrut (2001) in stressing the uniqueness of Hittite cultures as a forerunner of today's Turkish cultures with strong leaders at the helm of both. On the other hand HITITLER also stresses the importance of Hittite culture as a bridge between East and West, a concept that persists today in Turkish cultures. It is this ability to negotiate between cultures that has helped to sustain peace; if we recognize that ability, then we can follow the Hittites' example and do the same thing in our own times.To be honest, the documentary does become a little bogged down in historical minutiae, especially in the way it chronicles the reign of one king after another. Perhaps there ought to have been more emphasis on the Hittites' legacy rather than on historical narrative. Nonetheless the film is ravishing to look at with its spectacular battle sequences and use of bright colors and striking imagery to make its points.",

            "storyline": "Stanley, a South African director and screenwriter, first came to my attention thanks to the controversy of 1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau (which was well documented in 2014's Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau). Long story short (and I recommend that you watch the film and read more about this, as it is amazing), Stanley spent four years developing the film only to have New Line continually fight his vision at every turn. I look at Stanley as a true artist, someone who was unwilling to deal with the mainstream Hollywood of today of meetings and focus groups and numbers versus casting flickering images of truthsaying onto modern cave walls. Most amazingly, after being released from the film that he had brought to life, Stanley would sneak onto the set of the troubled production dressed as one of the dog-human hybrids that Moreau had created. He had become fiction so that he could witness a real-life disaster first hand. Much like how the magician dreams of lead becoming gold, the true story became just as unreal as the tale that they were filming.The Otherworld is an attempt by Stanley to explain the place where he lives — the French Pyrenees — and a moment in his life that even his art has not allowed him to fully translate to reality. This area is known as \"The Zone,\" a place of occult lore, thanks to ley lines, UFO sightings, and Rennes-le-Château, a church rebuilt by 19th-century priest Father Bérenger Saunière. The strange tales of his wealth and secrets — some of them celebrated in a 1948 article and others used by a local merchant to build tourist interest in the area — led to 1982's book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, which postulated that Saunière had the true Holy Grail — proof that Jesus Christ had survived the Crucifixion, married Mary Magdalene and had children — and used that to build his wealth. Other claims were that he had the actual body of Christ's wife or a gateway to another dimension. Again — I could spend an entire website explaining more about Rennes-le- Château, particularly the insanity that the authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail lost their plagiarism suit against Dan Brown, whose book The Da Vinci Code popularized these legends.This area was also home to the Cathars, who the film postulates frightened the Christians that came here, as they placed women in positions of power, and the Knights Templar, mystical Christian knights that were burned at the stake for blasphemy (or political and economic regions). Any genre fan will tell you that the Knights inspired The Blind Dead films. Again, I urge you to study more and learn of their complicated history.Stanley meets magicians, sorcerers, tour guides and normal folks who have all been impacted by the place he calls home, never commenting on just how good of a grasp on reality his subjects have. At the heart of the film are two incidents where Stanley himself met a female presence, told through his actual words (and those of his wife). The recounting of their second meeting are incredibly interesting, as Stanley almost breaks down in tears describing what happened.",

I remember seeing him in a documentary where it literally showed his ridiculous reactions more than the actual science it was supposed to be showing. Cox definitely tries very hard to be a public darling, but it just doesn't work - at least not for people who are interested in the science and not his newest hairdo.He wants to be the next Carl Sagan, but he just isn't. I keep trying these docs, but it just doesn't ever comes off well. I am so confused what the BBC sees in him. I guess they are really trying to reach a younger audience. But Cox isn't the answer. Physicists actually make fun of these docs. It's a shame, because the public NEEDS docs like this.",

A recent example is the confusing documentary The Mole Agent, where, in order to make elderly residents of a nursing home speak, they were deceived by introducing an infiltrator posing as a resident.\"In the case of Marco Berger's film, it seems that a similar operation was carried out. He presents his film as a documentary, although he makes a caveat in the opening titles. Perhaps it should be defined as \"docudrama in situ\", since the plot follows two characters who are actors and who are (or are they?) friends (Vilmar Paiva y Franco Heiler). One of them participates in the Carnival troupes and the other participates more as a close spectator. Are they from Gualeguaychú? Do they actually participate in the Carnival every year?There is a predominance of dialogue scenes (with other young people who are probably really comparsas), a few reportage style, some during the parades and many, but many, in the changing rooms, with the usual gloating of typical Berger close-ups of tails and bundles and some nudes of the boys (chongos) and the backstage of how they are \"riding\": makeup and a wardrobe that looks like a mixture of starlet and gladiator.The result and even the objective of the film are at least confusing (helped by a direct sound shot that makes it difficult to follow the dialogues) and tiring because of its repetitions: did the director try to portray a potentially homoerotic environment or substrate in those boys who dress? their outfits and parade with pride and without conflicts or is it all the result of the intervention that he carries out and of his projections and markings?Perhaps the only clear thing is the concept of carnival as a time of leave, in this case those taken by the young people who make up the troupes, with great enthusiasm and pride.",

The film features archival footage from the war in Afghanistan paired with interviews of the soldiers who recorded and lived through the battles depicted in the footage. During the interviews, they cut the footage to create a glitching effect when the veterans discuss their panic and anxiety attacks from the war. This gave me a visual representation of the disorientation they felt as they lived through the battle that was being shown throughout the film. There was also a vignette effect used during these anxiety attacks that portrayed the feeling of claustrophobia the soldier was experiencing. These editing tactics only made the emotions and feelings expressed throughout this documentary more powerful and moving. Above the Best is definitely a strong, emotionally driven film that is important for people to see.",

Documentary Competition\"The Exiles\" is directed by Violet Columbus and Ben Klein and it's about Documentarian Christine Choy who decides to track down three exiled dissidents from the Tiananmen Square massacre, in order to find closure on an abandoned film she began shooting in 1989. Including interviews with filmmaker Todd Phillips and political commentator Wu'erkaixi. This documentary is really interesting about the political situation that happened with China back during the Tiananmen Square situation and how the situation has effected certain individuals. Throughout this documentary, Christine Choy is a very strange but funny character and it is really interesting to listen to her speak throughout this documentary. The presentation is really good with good effects, some good animation provided, good sound design, and good music provided throughout the movie.There are some many interesting conversations provided by the participants. The tone goes from sometimes comedic and sometimes depressing at the same time. Directors Columbus and Klein does a really good job capturing the roles and communicating with it's participants to feel real and living. Politics isn't something that I am good at talking because it's a subject I don't often feel comfortable talking about. As an Chinese-American, it's still interesting to learn about many aspects of China even if it's controversial. I may not agree with everything about what is going on with China and the other states being involved, but there's still a lot of interesting discussions provided.I am surprised that I didn't see this at the festival when I attended it back in January.Rating: A-",

The events which ended WW2 the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were just the beginning of events which continue to this day and will do so long after I am gone from this earth.I sometimes wonder if Truman had invited Hirohito to the USA to witness the test of the atomic bomb and said \" I think you should surrender before this is used in a war capacity against your citizens \" whether Hirohito would have gone back to his people and surrendered to avoid such a catastophic loss of life.The Japanese people who suffered after the bombings and continue to suffer to this day MUST be a warning to the world about the power these weapons have to destroy mankind. I also think that Oppenheimer realised what he had done by allowing this to be created. For he had become the destroyer of worlds. His words taken from the scriptures were indeed true.Sadly Hirohito was proclaimed as a god by the Japanese people and I have no doubt that his ego and position would not have allowed him to show a form of weakness and vulnerability to his people. At such a high cost.Yet man continues to meddle with nuclear power like he knows what he's doing and disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima are evidence that we simply don't know what we are doing. The documentary has left me with questions and thoughts and worries for the future of mankind. Ultimately the people who survived the bombings are the only people with first hand knowledge of the pain and suffering that has been created.It is an amazing documentary which gives the truth about the events after the bombings. The politics and control of information to obfuscate the reality is just as terrifying as the events themselves.",

Living in Michigan most of my life I saw Mrs. Parks as someone who performed a brave act in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus as requested by the driver on the segregated municipal bus line of Montgomery, Alabama. She was arrested and that initiated the famous Montgomery Bus Boycott. But to learn that she was a civil rights activist both before that incident and for her whole life thereafter was startling. And to find out that she lived in poverty for many years after moving to Detroit, with male civil rights activists being unwilling to employ her, sheds light on the patriarchal structure of even the black civil rights leaders of that time. This film is an engrossing story of a humble and non-assuming female activist, directed and shot in stylish fashion by directors Johanna Hamilton and Yoruba Richen.",

Does some very simple but effective things with great emotional impact- the endless descent into the mine, the sequence where Panos Cosmatos takes over (:3), the workers cleaning themselves after a day of work at the mine, a middle-aged man scratching away at dead skin- all of them masterful, gut-wrenching scenes.The narration, while very sparse, has a very central importance in the film. It keeps at bay the feeling that the film is just running around in circles, and lends a loose structure of sorts to the film, which I think makes it more effective. Felt like a film that will haunt me for some time at least.",

This guy is sick.This auditioning is going on behind the former iron curtain where he can pay any porn actor way less. It is sad that these girls are letting themselves be sold out like this, what, in the end, is at the heart of patriarchy, an misogyny, easy mark, push over sex objects. Need we wonder at all the ass and breast grabbing, and rapes, coming to light these days? The very nature of the questions he hurls at them at the start of the interview, crosses boundaries of decency, and if they accept that, they will accept more. Like looking at porno photos with him. He goes after the innocent ones. So glad I got to see this underbelly scum work, to see how a sleaze bag Lothario operates these days,especially as I am from Budapest and understood everything said in Hungarian. Sajnalak, csajok.",

            "storyline": "I'll just get this out of the way: I believe that 'Citizens United' in effect suppresses the free speech of real citizens. So yeah, I am biased. Having said that, this is not a review of the subject but a review of the documentary itself. And, all things considered, \"Dark Money\" is honestly a pretty middle-of-the-road documentary.Here's what I liked about it: I don't live in Montana so it was interesting to learn a little about the state's history and about their local politics. I also have to commend the filmmakers for taking on a decidedly non-sexy issue that is easy to overlook. The film also speaks to individuals with a range of political backgrounds and ideologies, although there's limited representation of the \"dark money\" interests themselves for obvious reasons (interest which, it must be said, are often not corporations directly but wealthy individuals with strong corporate leanings).Here's what I didn't like: the film drags in many spots. The same ideas end of being restated multiple times. The numerous individuals and organizations involved can be difficult to keep track of. The documentary would have been stronger by focusing in on just a few individuals rather than trying to tell a universal story. The film's term \"dark money\" also combines a number of related yet distinct concepts, such as: campaign finance, political action committees, disclosure, corporate influence, campaign coordination, and good old fashioned political corruption. Again I feel the film's argument would have been stronger if they have focused on a specific case instead making more nebulous, universal arguments.Overall, I also just don't think this documentary will change anyone's opinion. Those who dislike \"dark money\" will like the film because it confirms what they already believe. Those who view \"Citizens United\" as a win for free speech, will dismiss this film as biased. And the depressing truth is that those citizens who can be swayed by random political mailers are never going to watch a rather boring documentary, no matter how important the subject it covers is.Given the polarized nature of our nation at the moment, maybe the sad truth is that it's just too much to expect any documentary to change anyone's mind. Still, I can't help but feel a more deft documentary on the subject of \"dark money\" could have, at the very least, gotten a few more people thinking about these issues and what they mean for our democracy.",

However, this documentary fails to deliver because it becomes one of the most uninteresting, basic, and typical documentary that fails to dive deeper into what makes Sue Bird special.Many of the conversations, interviews and themes explored wasn't strong as they felt repetitive, uninteresting, and unemotionally connected. The documentary tries to offer some interesting explorations about Bird but it really feels like a youtube made documentary that feels unfinished and pre-written.I didn't really get much from this documentary and it doesn't really do a good job on what made her so special and why she is important. It just feels like some poorly made documentary made by the sports company to promote their brand honestly.Overall, not a good documentary.",

From that moment his life and his family's becomes a living hell because in Mexico you need to prove your innocence, so you're guilty until proved otherwise. So he's convicted for 20 years and now a couple of young lawyers take on the mission of helping him get his freedom and record all the re-trial process.IMHO, it's the kind of important film not to be missed, and most important, to take action and demand that several reforms must be made.",

            "storyline": "1982, the south Atlantic, a small group of islands are in contention. The Argentine population had been taught for years that the Falkland Islands belonged to them. A partition of South America had been drawn up hundreds of years earlier by religious authorities, giving Brazil to Portugal and the rest of South America to Spain. The Falklands fell into Spanish territory. The islands were further linked to Argentina because a mountain range in that nation ran to the coast, disappeared under the south Atlantic Ocean, and cropped up again as the Falkland Islands. A few Argentines occupied the barren and windswept place until forced out by British colonialism sometime in 1833. Since then, for almost 150 years, the Falklands Islands have been British in thought, word, and deed. The population was small, limited to a few sheepherders, and largely ignored.But to Argentina, their claim was still legitimate. They've always called the islands the Malvinas and they still teach that name to school children, according to a friend of mine in Buenos Aires. They had never formally ceded the islands to the British. It's worth nothing that historical claims can be tricky propositions. After the Mexican-American War, the United States was ceded control over what is now California -- but never over the Channel Islands like Catalina, which are still formally part of Mexico. How far back into history do we want to go in making territorial claims? The American Indians once \"owned\" all of the Western hemisphere and had done so for some 35,000 years before Europeans began taking over without any concessions from the Indians.During a terrible period of Argentine history, when it was ruled by a ruthless military junta that was loathed by its citizens, the government launched an invasion of the Falklands and occupied it with thousands of troops. If the intent was to deflect attention from civil unrest, it worked perfectly. The streets were filled with citizens cheering the invasion. The occupation was initially benign. No rapes, no crimes, no mistreatment of the Brits or their handful of captured British marines. Then small changes were introduced. Argentine stamps on letters, not English stamps. Drivers must change the side of the road they drive on. In London, the government of Margaret Thatcher was in no mood for negotiations, despite the efforts of American diplomats to find a solution short of war. A flotilla of British ships was launched accordingly, to the tune of \"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.\" The film's treatment of the war itself sometimes seems perfunctory. Nothing about British strategy -- the more remote regions first, then assaults on larger communities on the way to the capital. We learn practically nothing about the weapons platforms -- the Argentine fighter-bombers, the British Harriers, the Exocet missiles. No mention of the long flight of obsolete Vulcans that cratered the runways with conventional bombs, precluding landings of more troops and supplies from Argentina. No mention that the cruiser Belgrano was torpedoed and sunk by a British submarine although it was still outside the area that had been quarantined by London. In the film the ship, formerly the USS Phoenix, was simply sunk. Many of the survivors froze to death and we see the reactions of their relatives, still grieving. In fact, about as much time is given to participants as to the combat itself. There was a good deal of suffering (and pride) on both sides. Argentina was a country of polo players and racing car drivers and their pilots were skilled and courageous, causing damage to many of the British ships.The main impression left by this documentary, at least for me, is the mutual respect held by both Brits and Argentine military personnel, especially the pilots of both nations. None of the interviewees was gripped by a passionate hate of the enemy. Of course the British \"won\" but only after an appalling amount of bloodshed and material waste prompted by a desperate, failing political system.The enemy's response was misjudged by both sides. The Argentines believed that the British would only shrug and accept the occupation as a fait a compli; the British believed that a show of force by a world power would induce the Argentines to withdraw back to the mainland. But, once begun, the war became a matter of national honor and the Falkland Islands became only a symbol. What foolishness.It's a decent documentary but there are others (and several books) that are more detailed and more perceptive.",

It's become a mini ritual to get a few ex-CrossFitters round and do a watch party.This said, I completely agree with the other reviews that I've seen. This doco was SO poor from a story-telling perspective. There were ample sub-stories that it just didn't get into at all, and focused only on the final podium placers. One of the stories of the games was the sandbag ladder, and the doco didn't even talk about the 'drama' of when the new top bag was brought out.Glad to hear that there is a new production company coming in for next year, but if you're considering watching this and you're a CF fan, don't.

And I thought, I mean I took my hand and ran it up the wall in my room, and I thought that sounds insane, I mean who would be stupid enough to take blind kids rock climbing. So I signed up.[audience laughter] Erik Weihenmayer: And there's one thing though that hasn't changed since the very first time I went rock climbing almost 20 years ago, and that's the reach.

C. who has elected to defend the cases of the January 6 insurrectionists. Heather Shaner has spent over 40 years defending people who can't afford an attorney. She believes everyone is entitled to a trial. She was formerly a social worker and wants to not only see the best in people, but to educate them on how to be better human beings.You may leave the film as incensed as I was, by the way in which the defendants are taught by Shaner to manipulate the Court to receive the least amount of prison time - if they actually get any significant sentence at all. After their trials, one defendant appears to remain somewhat ambivalent regarding Trump's actual loss of the race, even though that was part of their plea for leniency. Perhaps this is the point of the doc, to elicit a reaction, to promote discussion. Heather believes her clients are \"not a danger to society\". Well, that remains to be seen. The doc is well made, Heather's clients are well represented by the filmmakers, they're allowed to speak their piece. Heather believes that the person who is actually responsible for provoking the insurrection has yet to be held accountable, and that negligence of the rule of law should anger us all, regardless of party. But that does not excuse the actions of the January 6th insurrectionists, who, according to one of her clients, might actively participate once again.",

The answer is guitarist extraordinaire Joe Bonamassa, and co-directors Phillippe Klose and Kevin Shirley serve up a documentary to remove some of the mystery for those familiar with Smokin' Joe, and an unveiling for those who aren't. If you are asking yourself, \"Joe who?\" you should know that he opened for BB King ... as a 12 year old prodigy!\"I've got to go become the other guy.\" Joe B confesses that's his approach to prepare for a gig. He's been described as bi-polar (not a clinical diagnosis) as he alternates between Joe in blue jeans and a ball cap, and Joe Bonamassa on stage in a suit and shades. And what a transformation it is. Joe is such a laid back guy that his Los Angeles home is nicknamed \"Nerdville\", yet when his stage presence and music is explosive and beloved by his audiences.A treasure trove of concert clips is provided, including a few from Joe's early years. We learn of his struggles within the music industry, including his time with the band, Bloodline, which featured the offspring of legends Miles Davis, Robbie Krieger, Berry Oakley, and Sammy Hagar. Joe's agent and partner Ray Weisman provides a great deal of background on the difficulty associated with helping Joe find his niche, and the risks and rewards of their founding their own record label in order to \"own\" Joe's music. It's fascinating to hear how a guy so talented faced so many challenges in discovering the right path.Speaking of clips, we see Joe perform at such hallowed venues as Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, The Greek Theater, and Royal Albert Hall ... with Eric Clapton. A personal favorite is the clip of Joe performing as the great Paul Rogers (Free, Bad Company) sings lead. A concert at the stunning Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado shows up a couple times, and we see Joe and his producer Kevin Shirley (also co-director on this film) make a trip to the \"Crossroads\", where the legend of Robert Johnson was born. Other influences for Joe include Albert King, Freddie King, BB King, and Muddy Waters.Joe Bonamassa natural talent likely stems from his family of musicians. His great-grandfather and grandfather played trumpets, while his own father was a guitarist. His progression through producers and collaborators includes Miami Steve Van Zandt, Phil Ramone, Tom Dowd, and, Kevin Shirley. Of course neither genetics nor affiliation explains Joe's extraordinary work ethic and obsession with challenging himself. We see his joy in music as he's interviewed in front of a wall of Fender amps ... the same amps he once dreamed of owning.\nArriving December 8, 2020 on VOD from Paramount Home Entertainment",

For those not up on their history the film begins with this mini history lesson, explaining why this act of desegregation was so essential. The film covers a pretty depressing subject, the fact that American schools have become as segregated as they were before the mass desegregation efforts of the civil rights movements in the 60s. In a series of talking heads the film interview activists, students and teachers. It's well constructed and easy to watch and covers a lot of ground. The documentary is made pretty conventionally, a series of talking heads. Still, it's worth watching as an introduction to the education crisis.",

It's both a subjective, intimate and personal narrative told by syroechkovskaya about growing up in post-soviet Russia, her relationship with Kimi and the doomed generation of people from broken families, who have no sights of a better future. While the film is pessimistic, sad and gloomy in it's overall tone, it also has a lot of humor as well as sweet and intimate moments, while syroechkovskaya seems to have a sense of self irony when looking at her young teenage self.Technically and it's tone and subject matter there are a lot of similarities to Joonas Neuvonens Reindeerspotting and Lost Boys in that the film is composed of footage shot by digital hand held cameras and it focuses on one specific charather, while also including the film maker as a clear subject and a charather as well. There are also overlaps in the subject matter as well in that there is a lot drug use and film centers around experience of youth. How to save a dead friend however has a stronger societal narrative and ties the lives of it's main charathers strongly to the surrounding society, giving a picture of repression and negletence of the state towards it's people, that has produced the generation of young people who drive themselves towards oblivion. In addition to footage of hand held cameras there are animations that represent the early 2000's internet asthetics and the film ends in a beautiful 3d animation seuqence. The music of the film represents the youth culture it portrays and its a combination of \"Russian grunge\" and synth waves, that work well to immerse the viewer to the context.A tragic, yet funny and intimate film that has a strong societal narrative.",

I love how there's no vulgarity in their music and lyrics. Just amazing, genuine, heartfelt music. They pour their hearts and souls into all their songs and it shows not only in the music itself but in their LIVE concerts as well. Their music live is just as great if not better live than in studio.They've been my favorite band for a few years now, and when I saw the LIVE in Vegas album was out, I listened to it immediately, and needless to say, I've cried so many times just listening to it. When I heard a movie of the concert was out, I got so excited and immediately went to watch it on Hulu.Their concerts are just so amazing! The energy, the aesthetic displays, the visuals, the sound, the showmanship from every single member. It's so mesmerizing! I cannot wait for the day I get to watch them live and experience such a marvelous event.Also, they just really show so much love to their fans, you can tell they're grateful for every one of us, I've cried listening to the album and watching the LIVE concert just from the little speeches Dan has given.I loved watching and listening to each and every single band member give their stories of the evolution of the band and their own experiences as individuals.I HIGHLY recommend watching this movie if you're a fan or if you don't know much about them but you like their music.",

It's difficult to summarize his life because, well, it had so many ups and downs, some of them reaching clinical levels. He may have been a genius but he was no businessman, in an era of cut-throat businessmen, and he became something of a fantasist in his later years.I have a limited background in electronics but some of this material was presented a little to fast for me to grasp. What's the good of telling us that Tesla invented the generator when you don't know what a generator is. (It's a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, if I remember.) He filed a number of patents, important in the development of alternating current -- the kind that turns your light and this computer on -- and in radio, but the credit and the income were largely ripped off by more cunning types like Westinghouse, Edison, and Marconi.Tesla was pretty neurotic, when you come right down to it. He couldn't touch hair, for instance, and couldn't manage to hook up with any beauties of the period despite his celebrity and wealth. He wasn't a mathematical wizard but, like Einstein, he came to waste a lot of time on scientific canards -- Einstein on the unified field theory, Tesla on a means of transporting electrical energy without wires. It would have been nice if Tesla succeeded. We can all do without electrical cables, utility poles, and those giant towers of electrical power that mar our landscapes and interfere with flying kites. However, with the best will in the world, we cannot light a bulb in London with a beam of electrical power originating in New York.The film brings up the so-called Star Wars Initiative and the atomic bomb and some other modern wonders but is finally forced to admit that they owe little to Tesla. What we do owe to Tesla, at least in part, is Times Square and Osaka, where the lights never dim and it's always as bright as day. In fact, almost everything that runs on electricity owes something to Tesla. Even the electric chair, but not flashlights.In his old age, Tesla received a stipend from Westinghouse that enabled him to live in modest comfort in the Hotel New Yorker. He spent most of his time in the park, feeding pigeons, and died at 87. It was a tumultuous and productive life. Whether or not Tesla found it satisfying, no one can say for sure, including this documentary.",

Don't miss the opportunity to witness this beautifully absurd compilation of profound wisdom. I've spent years researching non duality and eastern texts that are adamant on predetermination and that we lack control of our experience. Which feels passive and docile sometimes. These channellers empower us to take responsibility for one's state of being and creatively output.

My wife wasn't laughing either for most of it, she did have the odd snigger here and there and I asked her if she thought ti was good, her reply was 'it's okay, not her best work'.I think some comics miss the boat a little by appealing to a very narrow fan base, super narrow in Gadsby's case, she pretty much had me thinking 'I don't think she likes me even though we've never met' within 10 minutes.",

The original was the original, and each copy was a copy - a forgery. With photography and then film that began to get complicated. The original was a negative. Without a print, it did not exist. Just the opposite, each copy was the original. But now with the electronic, and soon the digital, there is no more negative and no more positive. The very notion of the original is obsolete. Everything is a copy. All distinctions have become arbitrary. No wonder the idea of identity finds itself in such a feeble state. Identity is out of fashion.",

But as I started watching it I quickly realized how intriguing and interesting this subject is to me.About halfway through I started to think more and more about my parents, their future and my future. This is not a subject matter I've ever really considered or pondered but the more and more this film progressed the more and more I started to get sad about what is happening. The positive from this is that I will be volunteering at my local food bank or Meals on Wheels.Please see this film. I know it may not be a sexy subject matter but it's relevant and could be an issue that affects all of us in the future.",

            "storyline": "Cheating Hitler: Surviving the Holocaust (2019), directed by Rebecca Snow, is a poignant documentary that narrates the stories of three child survivors of The Holocaust focusing on their childhood experiences during Nazi persecution. It's a character driven documentary focussing on the personal stories of Helen Yermus, Rose Lipszyc, and Maxwell Stuart. It's a deeply meditative film exploring loss, pain, memory, man's inhumanity to man, and individual courage and the triumph of the will to survive. The documentary is deeply rooted within the stories of these three elderly Canadians who survived the horrors of Nazi German persecution as children during the Second World War when Nazi Germany was hellbent to anihilate the Jews of Europe.Snow weaves together many visual elements to create a compelling and insightful documentary where tragedy meets survival and individual heroism. Interstitial tiles are used to structure the film. The director knits together first person interviews, interviews with experts, archival footage, family photographs, narration, animation and recreated scenes from her characters' childhood experiences, montage editing, and mise-en-scene takes to make an emotionally moving and powerful documentary. The documentary incorporates both interior and exterior footage shot over an extended period of time at various locations which includes Canada, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, and Israel. Scenes alternate between Ms. Yermus, Ms. Lipszyc, and Mr. Stuart reflecting on their families, their childhoods, and their personal experiences of surviving The Holocaust, and as elderly senior citizens, coming to terms with their horrific traumatic experiences. The motif of loss, guilt, psychic pain weave themselves through the documentary giving the film depth and structure. Some of the most dramatic scenes in the film include Ms. Yermus's grandson visiting the site of her brother's execution at Kaunas IX Fort now a museum, Ms. Lipszyc visiting Sobibor Concentration Camp where her mother and siblings perished, and Mr. Stuart reuniting with the family of Janek and meeting Tova whom he rescued when she was an infant.Cheating Hitler: Surviving the Holocaust is a powerful film documenting the moving stories of three elderly Canadians who as children survived The Holocaust. Their collective experiences shine a light on the experiences of many survivors of The Shoah and is a painful remainder of man's inhumanity to man but more importantly, is a testament to the triumph of the will and individual heroism.The documentary is a labour of love and gives voice to the collective experience of the victims of Nazi persecution during the Second World War. Snow has not only created intimate portraits of three remarkable Canadians who triumphed over evil but has created a visual legacy which enshrines their personal stories which can be shared with future generations to educate them on the Nazi genocide inflicted on the Jews of Europe during the Second World War. The documentary has tremendous educational value and can serve as a vehicle to educate and promote social understanding and awareness. This documentary is deserving of your attention. Do see it!",

            "storyline": "Greetings again from the darkness. I'm not one of those who subscribe to the belief that documentary films should present all sides to the story in a \"just the facts, ma'am\" style. In fact, I respect a filmmaker who is so passionate about a topic that he/she enthusiastically attempts to overwhelm the viewer with \"proof\" that their opinion is the definitive truth and no further debate is needed. Here, renowned director Michael Winterbottom (The Trip, 2010) supports comedian/actor/activist Russell Brand in his agenda to educate the masses on the evil of big banks and rich people, and the need for re-distribution of wealth.Now that agenda may seem a bit odd coming from an admitted rich guy, but in fact, Brand's professional success lends some credibility to his argument  or at least it's a different approach than having a group of people living in poverty talk about how they got screwed by \"the man\".To say that Brand dumbs-down his explanation is certainly an understatement. To emphasize this, there are a couple of segments where he utilizes elementary level students to differentiate between rich and poor – what's fair and what's not. Concentrating mostly on the British economy, while also noting the similarities to the United States 2008 crash, Brand makes the argument that the turning point was approximately 35 years ago as Margaret Thatcher assumed power and Free Market Capitalism took over. It's a bizarre point coming from a native of a country whose Monarchs (not known for their \"fairness\") date back for centuries. However, this is an example of the keep-it-simple approach in getting the masses to join his quest.Borrowing a page from Michael Moore's long-successful script, Brand presents the big banks and the super rich as the villains of society. It's a common theme and one that's pretty easy to agree with  the banks were bailed out, and then proceeded to pay their upper management huge bonuses. The viable argument is, why don't they pay \"us\" back? Brand attempts to follow Moore's lead again (while referencing Joseph Campbell) by walking into the banks and asking to see the CEO's. These attempts fall flat, and leave us with Brand wise-cracking while bystanders try to figure out if it's all a prank.The most effective sequences involve Brand walking the streets of Grays London where he was raised. His discussions with the locals are real, and infinitely more enlightening than his storming into bank lobbies. The statistics don't lie – the rich are getting richer, while the rest of society struggles. George Carlin said it best  the poor are needed to keep the middle class motivated to work so the rich can benefit. Brand also rails against legal tax evasion via offshore accounts – especially in Grand Cayman. He lobbies for those accounts to be taxed and the money returned to the country of origin.Most of Brand's mission is preaching the importance of fairness, and the claim is made that by definition, capitalism is the inequality of power. Whether you agree with him or not, Brand is to be respected for using his celebrity status for a cause much more important than the best table in a restaurant, or courtside seats to a game. His simple-is-best approach carries right through to the end where he does offer up his list of recommendations to create a more fair system. If his simple and sometimes funny approach allows more people to enter into discussions, then his cause is worthwhile, even if his recommendations are a bit lacking in substance and depth.",

The biggest name of this group of people was Miss Cleo. I really don't know if you are not aware of who this person was that you would be interested in this documentary, but it is interesting anyway for a handful of reasons. People from Seattle were perplexed to see this woman who claimed to be a Jamaican voodoo priestess since she seemed so familiar to them. Her life in Seattle is a good basis as to how to take this person as you see this story unfold. The irony of this is that she was used by the PRN to make millions for them while some poor souls poured their hearts out to her and others in a desperate need to find answers to their problems. The Florida people who owned PRN used her identity (?) to make their money while paying her and others very little. The ending of this movie really confused me as she bravely fought her own confusions and angst to find a happy resolution to the rest of her life. The problem was for me. . .what self image was being addressed? I found the whole thing to be ironically confusing, yet I could not stop watching this.",

But I love my brother Ike too much to see it withheld from him.Ike is Christ and Judas, with Pontius Pilate washing his hands in a convenient basin, standing nearby watching the betrayal. He's Jack Sparrow, and the admiral of his own frothing, seven poetic seas.Nostradamus, and Sling Blade.Underestimate this man, and this band, at your own peril. As for me, I'll follow him into a burning house to rescue his guitar.Get some money Ike, and some glory too.",

I do think the documentary could have done a better job of helping us understand the breadth of the show. There were really only 4 dances that were featured in the documentary, but you can see by the costumes and clips of other dancers that the show had a lot more. I understand with the time constraint of a film that there wasn't time to go in depth into every dance, but I would have liked to have been given an overview into what the entire show included. A very entertaining and positive inside look at the world of dance!",

Many of them found much love and support from their foster parents and this was enlightening, it was surprising to hear how difficult it was for some to find an identity, feeling neither British nor Nigerian. We take our identities for granted and I found it sad to think how damaging it is not to be certain of one.

During that campaign, the press would print any rumor about any candidate, no matter how lacking in credibility the source.  This film has testimony from credible sources, and yet no newspaper or columnist here carried a review of it or any reference to it.  The two major exposes in \"Cover Up\" are: 1) the deal between the Republicans and the Iranian government to delay the release of the U.S. hostages until after the elections in 1980, so that Carter would not be re-elected; 2) the CIA involvement in import of drugs to this country.  Since 1988, the first point has been covered and confirmed in the mainstream media.  The second point was again \"revealed\" in the press last year, and was immediately met with strong denials; the story was squashed, and pressures applied which succeeded in eliciting a retraction from the newspaper in question,the San Jose Mercury.  Meanwhile, the organization that produced and distributed the documentary was put out of business by the federal government.  Those of us who know what's up know that this film tells the truth.  The black journalist (I can't believe I can't remember his name) who has a Sunday morning show on PBS had a guest who said that the U.S. government was behind not only the import of heroin from Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and the import of cocaine from Central America into the present, but has been involved in drug trade since just after World War II.  When I speak to African American audiences, I ask, \"How many here believe that the government is behind the import of drugs?\" the whole audience usually raises their hands.",

            "storyline": "This is a documentary that I got the opportunity to check out thanks to Kim from Dominion3. The doc is from Level 33 Entertainment. I've seen work from them in horror. Now this doesn't fall into that genre. There are horrific things that come from the subject here. I'm going to trend lightly and try to keep my personal beliefs to a minimum. Below is the synopsis as to why:A secret grassroots organization persistently fights to expand access to abortion pills across the USA keeping hope alive during a global pandemic and the fall of Roe v. Wade.Now a question I had in the wake of seeing this was I wonder how long the filmmaker followed these people and started doing this documentary. If they were just going to just follow them around and give a count of their struggles. The reason I bring this up is the pandemic made this extremely difficult to distribute this medication. It is interesting that I work in shipping logistics. The pandemic made my job harder when we couldn't import materials or products. This is even worse when what you need came from China and India.I am getting ahead of myself a bit though. For this, we learn about the woman who started this organization. We also get to meet people that help her. Not everyone is able to share their name as some go by aliases. There are even others that have their faces blurred and their voices altered. Part of this is that they don't want to be prosecuted if they're discovered. There are others as well that fear for their lives as well as their families if they are discovered. This made me both sad and angry. The reason here is that we shouldn't treat people this way, even if they have beliefs different than ours. I'm going to equate this to being a sports fan, sending death threats to people you're upset with or who think different than you should never be something that happens.Then to circle back to what I was saying. This group had their issues and they were amplified when the pandemic shut everything down. This made it where places you couldn't get an appointment as this wasn't deemed necessary. Concessions were made to distribute medication without an appointment. With the fall of Roe v. Wade, that became a problem.What I also like here is that we hear from women from different walks of life who have had an abortion. It isn't limited to one race or economic background. Not everyone shares, but they use a statistic that 1 in 4 have had an abortion. It should make you think twice before saying different things. What I mean there is that person might not be handling what their decision was well and could be triggering to them knowing negative things.I'm going to end this by saying that this is an interesting and well-made documentary. It is one-sided. I do want to point that out. It could have deepened this hearing from the other side of the argument. There was a lot of time and care put in to hide the identities of those that want their message out there, but fear of what could happen. I do like the different range of people interviewed, aside from my issue that led this off. This tugged at my heartstrings and made me a bit emotional at times.I would say this is a documentary to check out no matter what side you fall on. It would be interesting to hear someone who is 'pro-life' watch this and hear what they think. I'd even be interested in having a discussion if someone who watched this holds those beliefs. I will say that those against abortion might hate this. As a film, this falls by. It has good cinematography and editing with clips and information placed in. I enjoyed my time here as much as one can watching something like this for sure.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",

Experts expose practices and give insight what is really going on behind the scenes.Nowadays 90%+ of retail orders no longer see lit exchanges. Brokers can take your hard cash and you only receive an \"IOU\" instead of a real share, yet you have no real visibility. Wondering why banks are crashing lately? Well, lets talk about campaign funding and deregulation, revolving doors and the lack of risk management and accountability.It is about time people educate themselves, this is the only way to stop the growing corruption that threatens not just the financial markets, but the foundation of our society.",

In Viva Maestro, you can still sense this joy as an integral part of his character. However, about 30 minutes into the documentary, the mood takes a turn based on the unforeseen events in Venezuela that happened shortly after the beginning of shooting. A somber and pensive mood fills the remaining hour, interspersed with moments of bittersweet warmth.Viva Maestro is not simply a documentary about a conducting superstar. It's a story about El Sistema, the Venezuelan orchestras, and Gustavo's yearning to be a part of them again despite not being welcome in the country. His sadness is mixed with determination to continue using music to bring people together. It's about the desire to cause music to thrive, even in dark times.I found the filming, editing, and especially the graphics to be skillfully done, allowing for a clear presentation of the events and story told. The choice of classical music pieces in the background of different sections was also done well.Not everyone will find this documentary to be deep, certainly. But I was moved, enough moved that when I finished the documentary, I had to take an hour or so to think, to process. I would recommend giving this a watch, especially if you enjoy classical music or Dudamel's conducting.",

Some of the men are mentally ill; others have been confined there because they've committed criminal acts, or are disabled, or practice religion with zeal, or otherwise don't fit into family or society. The hospital, its crowded rooms around a courtyard corridor, is unutterably filthy and mostly unattended by any staff. This is real-life theater of the absurd. Watching it demands patience (almost 4 hours), which is richly rewarded as your normal senses of time and self ebb away. The camera leaves this floor only twice (there's one brief trip down a flight, and one key sequence where an inmate gets a few days' leave with his parents in a desolate village), and it cuts very rarely: there's as little as possible to obstruct your sense of being confined in this space of radical misery. Glimpses of kindness and human dignity among the inmates shine through all the more poignantly: a spark of love, a bit of fresh food from outside. Through this one corridor, \"Madness\" indicts the abuses of the bureaucratic Chinese state--but/and its biggest power lies in its cinematic originality.",

That's a hard ask because between the Anglicized title of a Japanese word, Omoiyari, which loosely means feeling compassion for others, and the fact that it's a documentary, I worry that it may not get the audience it deserves.K, as the central figure, an accomplished musician set out to tell the story of the dark period of American history, the Japanese internment during World War II. But it turns into something much more broader and beautiful than that. It talks about the difficulty of maintaining two identities in this country and what one loses, when one assimilates. Given that so much of our country is within one or two generations of coming from elsewhere, this is a theme that will resonate with almost everyone.The music, the visuals, and the way the story is knitted together are extraordinary, showcasing not only the creative wonders of Kishi Bashi, but tying that poignant music to a story of history and personal identity.In a few days, this will be available in Paramount+ and gather your family and watch it together. I promise, based on the in person audience and the tears that were shed that you will be moved. While the history is brutal, the promise brought around by Omoiyari, is hopeful, and needed in a time where our country is so divided.",

It is such a wonderful testimony to how human beings become more who they are meant to be through compassionate service to others. This is the message of the Gospel -- which Jesus spoke about but more importantly lived. This documentary demonstrates this so well without every becoming preachy or repetitive. What is also particularly moving is that the hospice volunteers often do not know what the other prisoners are in for (but the viewing audience does). They also have to deal with difficult patients without any thanks at times. Rather than giving up or even judging each other, these men persevered and grew more and more loving in the process. Watch it. It will stay with you.",

I think the point of the movie was to explore and show the different experiences and motives of the men and women using these services, which it did quite well. Some of these men seemed to have unrealistic expectations, looking for a super model type wife even though they themselves were overweight and older, but a couple seemed very genuine and sincere in their search to connect with someone. It was disheartening to see one man who was outright scammed and misled by a woman, and two more who were likely scammed. Two of the couples do get married, and the bond between one of them is quite evident and they seemed very genuine and in love--it was cute to watch them. The nicest thing about this film is that it shows the honest perspectives of both sides and even some of the parents, and it's very nice that it follows the story for quite some time (at least a year, if not more--I didn't keep track) to show how some of the relationships didn't work out while others seemed to get better.",

            "storyline": "Murder by the Coast is a Netflix true-crime documentary that is part-Spanish-part-English. It qualifies as a whodunnit, a case of wrongful conviction, and yet another instance of multiple women being mistreated. Writer-director Tània Balló approaches the murder case(s) objectively, never taking sides or focusing on wild theories surrounding it. The individuals picked for the interviews shed further light on two separate incidents of murder in a very direct, factual manner. Any text that appears within the film is shown first in Spanish, followed by English. This style encapsulates the Spanish-British story overlap in a perfect way. With a run-time of under 90 minutes, Murder by the Coast makes for crisp viewing.Coming to the incidents themselves, the documentary makes you feel for its central characters and questions the unfair nature of media trials. The trauma inflicted upon the women - ranging from the mothers of the murder victims, the lesbian who was convicted because she easily \"fit the profile\" (are you serious?), the woman who was attacked and left severely injured by the offender, the ex-wife of the offender - are all showcased without distorting facts or overplaying emotions. I'd have loved to see a short interview of Dolores Vázquez where she could speak against the miscarriage of justice meted out to her. The authorities who allowed Tony Alexander King to commit more murders and the media which resorted to feeding frenzy should both be ashamed of themselves.",

There are normal levels of self pressure (Halle to be the best for her Aunt), self doubt (Chelsea wondering if she could physically do it without passing out), and self discovery.It's all cut in with Wet Hot American Summer style interstitials of a PA rattling off a comment while kids play rugby.You will laugh and you will cry, and if you are an American like me you just might learn a little bit about John Farmhouse(?).By the end you will feel the pride that the audience must have felt during the final performance.I look forward to seeing what the director does next. Also if Chelsea isn't working on a stand up routine, someone point her in the right direction. She should be on stage making people laugh. Maybe an idea for a follow up documentary?",

But, to the extent that it is Zinn's ideas, it would not convince any viewer who didn't come into the movie already lionizing Zinn. And it fails even as an interesting story in its own right. I just noticed that the movie also was released in French and it is possible that some of its halting and stilted storytelling is a result of poor translation. Nonetheless, it remains a waste of time. And worse, for those who have not read Zinn's book, a laughably pathetic film version of an important work that can only bring disrepute upon Zinn's legacy.",

Nils is in Berlin, at the amazing looking Funkhaus. Recorded across several performances in 2018, what's essentially a concert film features an indulgent array of cameras capturing him playing solo. Surrounded in the round on an intimate stage by synths, sequencers, pianos and probably a ton of stuff I can't accurately identify. These sort of films can be a little hit or miss, but for me this is a hit. The music is sublimely beautiful, the setting looks wonderful and the cut is elegant and simple. There's no fluff, nothing more than there need be. As soon as artists are able to tour again. Go see Nils Frahm. I'll be there.",

A friend of mine send me a live performance of Warrior, and I judged cool, but not compeling enough. In that time, I was happy and have good friends.Then life happens, I broken a relationship, isolates from my friends and developed depression. In my most darkest hour, when was just surfing in internet to minimize my pain, I rediscover Aurora. Suddenly, I fell the light and warm of Sun on my skin again.It was really a point of hope in my life. How could she exist? His purity, naive and talented personality, so protected and perfect: a norwegian of a lovely family, the youngest of three sisters who pulled all the recessive genes for herself, a true sensitivity genius of music with one of the most touchable voices in this Earth.Her first songs carry so much beautiful, not only in her angelical voice, but in her dark lyrics. Always telling about a free spirit trying to living her best in this ephemeral world.Murder Song, Under the Water, Churchyard, Winterbird and Awakening, just to mention a few, are truly messages from a young girl who turn the cold of existence in her safe place.I was truly obsessed, and after a few weeks, I feel like I had watched every perfomance and interview of her available on YouTube and, yet, I was sad of all other perfomances that she made who wasn't recorded and will be forever lost in the time and in the memory of some lucky ones.But then, when I see this doc for this first time, I first realize that someday, our lovely and sweet Aurora who become a friend of mine when I most needed, will eventually grown and go to the world. She wasn't and never will be this idealized persona that we as fans around the world created to themselves.We was just spectators of her personal journey to accept how things really are in this industry, and become a well-selled musician. I think this phase officially began with the release of Cure for Me and what came next.But before all of this sucess, she fights was a true free spirit, and captivating so many admirers along the way.And for this, she will always be a genius, as this doc made clear.",

But.Above all else, it's Yuzuru Hanyu delivering his signature quality skates-beyond that, each program connects together in a stream of consciousness that transports you into his world and guides you gently through it.It made me realize that the Yuzuru we saw in competition was such a small glimpse of his talents.Of course he can skate and he skates beautifully as ever. He brings a competition level program just before the midway point and it's as heart-pounding as ever to watch it live not knowing how it'd go and praying for the best. He's insane for doing this, by the way.But he's also an excellent artist, storyteller, narrator, and none of this could ever hope to be judged or presented properly in any of the years we've seen him. Here, I think we finally get the true inkling of what he's capable of.All of these talents for his skating, to take the presentation of his skating to greater heights by weaving a beautiful and haunting narrative of his journey, struggles, and redemption. And through it all, his joy for skating is the most evident. Maybe he even lost sight of it once, on the journey to get here, but he reclaims it anew. The dome packed full is a beautiful sea of lights and the ice loves him back.GIFT is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It's got the spectacle and grandeur of Tokyo Dome and the terrifying ephemeralness of a top athlete in his prime whose presence shines brighter than any flashy lighting you could cast on him, and it's truly made for this place and this one night.Although there were regrets in the past, although he learned that regrets may be inevitable, he keeps moving forward everyday.I never imagined an ice show could be like this and I still think he's insane. I also haven't moved on from this show since it happened almost a week ago, so maybe I'm becoming a bit insane, too.",

            "storyline": "I didn't find this French documentary engaging enough. The scam is simple, lacking finesse and smarts, and only the ineptitude of the government makes small group of low-lives rich beyond their wildest dreams. In a nutshell, the scammers charge tax when selling CO2 quotas, and don't report the tax to the government, basically keeping the tax for themselves. The main character in this French documentary, Marco Mouly, is a Tunisian who has spent his life scamming. I found him unpleasant because he's bragging non-stop, and obviously has no moral compass. He lets his best friend down, and has no regard for anyone but himself. Despite the fact that Marco Mouly talks a mile a minute, he manages to say absolutely nothing.The scammers don't even hide their money: they spend like Croesus on fancy cars, parties, and are getting the red carpet treatment everywhere. As the scammers' group grows, so does the risk of being found. In fact, it's likely the government wouldn't have caught them if it wasn't for a spurned father in-law. Frustratingly enough, even after catching the culprits, the government wasn't able to recuperate most of the money, There was nothing smart about these scammers, they just had guts (or lack conscience), and got lucky.",

It generated tons (and I mean: tons) of memes because how weird, unexpected and fanciful the whole story was.This documentary tells the story of Cositorto, a salesmen + preacher who created Generation Zoe, a Ponzi scheme across many countries in Latin America, and even in some countries in Europe.While all the crucial points of the story are there, I felt like there could have made a better job explaining more about the promises made to deliver money and some of the supposed business Generation Zoe was investing in. While the most important are there, others were left out.There are some witnesses telling their stories, how they got into it, how they got out (if they did), and even interviews from Cositorto itself.I had a great time, lots of memories came in, but I felt that if you didn't know anything about the story, it wouldn't be that great. I watched it with my girlfriend and I had to add some clarifications or explanations for some points of the story.",

We then go to \"Winter Park, FL\", where Aldarondo attends a high school reunion. Things might eg awkward... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: even thought this is co-directed by Cecilia Aldarondo and Sarah Enid Hagey, this is really the story of Cecilia. The movie starts out slowly, almost to the point where I was considering to bail on it, but then something magical starts to happen, and the documentary picks up steam (and beauty and empathy). For some, this still may not be enough and they cannot overcome some cringe-worthy passages in the film. But by the time we come to the enactment of a \"My So-Called Life\" scene, and then the Tori Amos video \"Crucify\", it all made perfect sense to me. Kudos to Cecilia Aldarondo for having the courage to share her feelings with us.\"You Were My First Boyfriend\" premiered at this year's SXSW festival to immediate critical acclaim. I read a good review of it in the NY Times last week, peaking my interest. The movie just started showing on HBO and also streaming on Max, where I caught it the other night. If you are in the mood to reflect what it was like to live through adolescence, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",
