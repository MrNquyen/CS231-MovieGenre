This was because the film was originally made for TV, with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (or 16:9) in mind -- without the projectionists' manual correction, the aspect ratio of the theatrical release (1.85:1) would have resulted in heads being cut off at the top of the silver screen. Lynch also asked to raise the volume of the theater's sound system by three decibels when the film was playing. The note ended with the words, \"Your friend, David Lynch.\"",

Due to a 1978 landmark government ruling (Oliphant v. Suquamish), the Supreme Court stripped tribes of the right to arrest and prosecute non-natives who commit crimes on native land. If neither victim nor perpetrator are native, a county or state officer must make the arrest. If the perpetrator is non-native and the victim an enrolled member, only a federally-certified agent has that right. If the opposite is true, a tribal officer can make the arrest, but the case must still go to federal court. This quagmire creates a jurisdictional nightmare by choking up the legal process on reservations to such a degree, many criminals go unpunished indefinitely for serious crimes.",

In the subsequent novel \"Ozma of Oz,\" one of the books on which this film is based, Dorothy and her friends meet the Nome King who possesses a magical belt with properties similar to those of the silver shoes.

I don't know how anyone can make a movie and not rehearse. Even if you can't put it into the budget, figure out how to rehearse on weekends. That's what I preach because it just saves you so much time while shooting. You get to work out the kinks and bumps, and if the blocking doesn't quite work, or an actor's bumping on a line, or whatever. You have time to rewrite it, you can rework it with them. Also, we rehearsed with my DP (Menno Mans), so we were changing the shot list, we were finding better, more exciting ways to shoot a scene. So, by the time we got to shooting, on the day we could just fly... I think that I wouldn't be able to sleep the night before if I didn't know exactly what I was doing that day. (Laughs) I don't know how people do it. I mean, yeah, some people get off on that kind of spontaneity, but the thing is, something unexpected will always come up in filmmaking. It's like, no matter how much you prepare, too, no matter how much you rehearse, something unexpected will always come up. I think that that's the beauty of filmmaking. But for me, at least, when you're prepared ahead of time, you know exactly what you're doing coming in, then you can make those pivots very quickly because you've done all the work, and you've done all the prep.\"",

It was surreal, because they would bus you in in the middle of the night, so you couldn't see any of the country. They would just drop you in this resort compound, which was in fact surrounded by a razor-wire fence. You couldn't leave, much like in the film, and there was a kind of fake town where you could go shopping. The Chinese restaurant and the horrible discotheque in the movie are both based on that actual resort; the scene with the man on the ATV on the beach being chased by guards actually happened. And then, at the end of the week, they bused you back during the day, and you could see the actual immediate surrounding country, which was very poverty-stricken. There were people living in shacks. That contrast was obviously horrible, but also surreal, because you realized you had never actually entered the country; you were just dropped into this strange pocket of a sort of alternate dimension that had just grown up to become this tacky Disneyland mirror image of reality.\"",

In addition to producing the creature effects, Cosmatos trusted Winston to direct the second unit action sequences. \"George Cosmatos always let us take the lead in how to shoot the creature,\" noted Landon. \"He was such a big-hearted person, he would throw up his hands, and say 'I don't know what I'm doing.' He'd just admit it and let us do what we knew how to do. We know what our characters can do and we know the best way to use them. We're thinking about what our characters are going to have to do on the set the entire time we're building them. So we are goldmines of information and knowledge.

Instead of expanding existing scenes with the new footage, the entire film was edited from scratch, which resulted in a version that doesn't contain a single frame from the theatrical version. Visual effects were used to enhance scenes and replace cheap sets and backgrounds, and AI technology was used to restore previously unusable dialogue that was plagued with background noises. A new music score was composed as well, in contrast to the public domain ballet music. A limited theatrical release was planned in late 2020, but it was delayed due to legal difficulties, distribution issues and the Covid-19 pandemic. This version eventually premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023, with high remarks by actors Malcolm McDowell (who previously had been ashamed by the film) and Dame Helen Mirren.",

I improvised the whole movie. I was only ever shown the first ten pages and even they were thrown away once we were on set. We shot the movie in 8 days. I was drawn to the idea of how it would feel stepping into scene after scene having no idea what was gonna be thrown at me. I've never taken on anything like that and it was both challenging and exhilarating. You can't help but be in the moment.Obviously there were certain parts where I would have to be guided in a general direction but mostly it was flying by the seat of my pants. Amazing work by the rest of the cast having to play off me given I had no idea what was about to come out of my mouth. And to our director Brian Goodman-love you brother.\"",

Normally, the assistant director would read the actors' lines, and the extras would react. However, Laughton, who was fascinated with the whole process of filmmaking, begged to help. So he came in on his day off and read all of the off-camera speeches to the jury members. He not only read his part but also the judge's, the prosecutor's, and even Marlene Dietrich's. According to biographer Maurice Zolotow in his book \"Billy Wilder in Hollywood\", \"it was an exhibition of craftsmanship such as Wilder had never seen. He believes that Charles Laughton had the greatest technical range and power of any actor, man or woman, whom he has known.\"",

After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being \"silly,\" and the church was \"beautiful.\" Nicolas Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life in terms of what the characters would actually say to each other, and that the scripted version was \"overwritten,\" so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.",

The five-man team were allegedly given the contract on Hoffa by Tony Provenzano, a captain in the Genovese crime family. Kuklinski claimed to have been paid $40,000 for the hit. Kuklinski said that he knocked Hoffa unconscious with a blackjack and, while holding Hoffa's chin up, thrust a hunting knife into the back of his head. Hoffa's body was then allegedly placed in the trunk of a car that was then crushed and sold as scrap metal to Japanese car makers. The claims only surfaced after Kuklinski's death in March 2006 in a book by author Philip Carlo and will probably never be substantiated.",

Crowe had one stipulation to all this and it was the scene where his character is looking at the kiddie porn and throws it in the trash he throws a cigarette so it would start burning inside the trash can. Schumacher agreed. Then out of the blue, Nicolas Cage's agent called Schumacher and told him that he wanted to do the film as well. Schumacher then contacted John Calley at Sony and told him that we can do the film with Crowe as a \"low budget, dirty handheld camera thriller\" or a much bigger film with Cage. Calley then agreed to do the film with Cage as the lead which eventually led to a much bigger budget. Schumacher realized Cage was right for the part when Cage reportedly told him, \"I want to play a role I can internalize instead of my normal Schtick.\"",

When you're watching the movie, if you look at the part where I take the gun out of the purse, before I come out into the parking lot, I grab a sheet off the bed. We did this many times with the sheet, and it just wasn't working, so I said, 'Forget the sheet, I am leaving the sheet behind.' So that's how I ended up getting so much more nude. I said, 'Forget it, if you want this, I'm going to go balls to the walls and here it is.'\" She added \"Because, as an actor, I just felt a lot better forgetting the sheet. I felt like it was more real. I felt like I was in my reality. I was, like, 'I would not be worrying about this stupid sheet right now! I just want the tape back.'\"",

She then cooks the corpse and feeds it to his husband, as the daughter picks up the bones from under the table and plants it under a juniper tree on the family's garden. A small bird appears from the grave, singing the song in question while picking a pair of new shoes, a gold chain and a mill stone, and then carries them to the house. The bird then gives the shoes to the daughter, the chain to the father and drops the stone on the stepmother, killing her. As she dies, the bird turns into a boy again and the story ends.

The relatable subject matter also helps in the engagement, and while a movie of this sort often runs the risk of coming across as quite preachy - Aattam never falls into this trap.But what sets this movie a class apart from the rest is the quality of the acting. Every single cast member has done a phenomenal job. I found myself hating, sympathising with, and being disappointed in the characters at different points through the movie - and the fact that this movie brought out such strong emotions from the audience is testament to the skill with which each actor portrayed their characters.Overall, this is a movie that makes you think long and hard about what you would have done if you were put in a similar situation, and this leads to some good introspection.",

My stuff was in there until one week before the film opened; that is when they cut 25 minutes out of that movie, a week before it opened. It went from around 140 to down around 95 minutes. They said, 'Cut all the behavior, action, comedy . . . '. I lost every major scene I had. That's the last time I ever cared about a movie because I went to the press screening and it was like getting kicked in the stomach, seeing what is not there. I was the third lead and now I looked like a dress extra. All the stuff that they had in the set-up, stuff in the trailer, all those scenes, were gone.\"",

She was now 48 years old, hadn't had a decent hit film for several years, her marriage to US politician John Warner was struggling, she was taking anti-depressants and had put on weight. When Rock Hudson was approached to do the film he said he would only do it if his long time friend Taylor could also be cast. The producers had assumed that Taylor's salary demands would put the film well over budget and were lining up Donald Pleasence as a possible alternative to Hudson. However, Hudson said that he could get Taylor to agree to star with him for the same salary he was being offered. Hudson convinced Taylor that coming to England for a few weeks to do a mainstream film with him, Lansbury and Tony Curtis (people Taylor had known for about 30 years) would be beneficial for her mental health plus give her a chance to catch up with old friends who lived there.",

            "storyline": "'Karma', directed by Anupam Patnaik, breathes new life into Odia cinema, presenting a mix of gripping storytelling, stellar performances, and a soundtrack that packs a punch. As a fan of Anubhav Mohanty, my excitement for this film was inevitable, but the movie transcends mere star appeal to deliver a truly engaging experience. Manas Padhiary's writing ensures that the narrative is both tight and full of unexpected turns, keeping the audience on edge until the credits roll.Wishing Anubhav, Suryamayee, Choudhury Jayaprakash Das, Sanoj, Divya, Manmay, and Nishant immense success and accolades for their stellar performances in Karma-may this film be a milestone in your already shining careers, taking each of you to new heights of stardom and recognition!One of the film's strongest aspects is its grounded, realistic approach, a refreshing deviation from the more fantastical elements often seen in regional cinema. The plot unravels through a series of well-crafted twists, making each development feel earned. Ashish Pradhan's background score enhances this with a South Indian flair, adding an intensity to key scenes that raises the stakes, especially in moments of high emotion. The dance numbers, meanwhile, are vibrant and catchy, already taking social media by storm and securing their place in the wider pop culture conversation. The comedy is another standout, with natural humor that feels authentic to everyday life, giving the film a relatable, lived-in quality.However, despite these strengths, the movie stumbles a bit in the first half. The pacing before the intermission feels sluggish at times, and the central concept of karma could have been explored with a bit more finesse. The action sequences, while entertaining, could have been more meaningfully tied to the theme, showing the karmic justice at play in a deeper, more nuanced way. Scenes that linked the criminals' fates to their past wrongdoings, especially in connection to the personal lives of the police officers, could have enhanced the emotional depth. A more detailed exploration of the mystery, particularly around the murder weapon and the death it caused, might have added even more intrigue. A postmortem scene that raised doubts or added layers to the case would have been a welcome addition-perhaps something to be explored in a potential sequel, Karma II.That being said, \"Karma\" is still a must-watch. Its flaws are minor compared to the larger success of the film as a whole, and I look forward to watching it again. How about you? Have you seen it yet? If not, it's worth your time!",

There were unnecessary \"this is how it could have ended\" moment and it just took unnecessary time and was boring, especially since we know that's not how the story would end. I liked the idea of solving mystery but it was not just that well made. I couldn't really like or dislike any character in this film and in this case it was not a good thing.All in all, it's watchable movie but nothing great. Necessary add: English is not my main language so sorry for any mistakes etc.",

Their move to Levittown was marked with racist harassment and mob violence, which required intervention by state authorities. Despite this, the Myerses continued to face harassment for nearly three months. This led to some of the residents being charged and served an injunction. The Myers family received national attention and support. The Myers family eventually moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1961 after William Myers accepted a job offer in Harrisburg. He later died in 1987 at age 65. Daisy Myers later wrote an autobiography in 2005 about the experience titled 'Sticks 'N Stones: The Myers Family in Levittown'. She worked as a school teacher for the York School District for over 30 years. She was called the \"Rosa Parks of the North\". She died in 2011 at age 86. The news interviews that appear on TV in the film are from the actual citizens. They come from a documentary called \"Crisis In Levittown, PA\" from 1957. It can be found on Youtube.",

Unfortunately Disney did not allow Anchor Bay to have the original cut, and only let them use the two \"alternate endings\" which now appear on the DVD. This explains why director John Hough referring to the movie as being finally edited the way he intended (the commentary was recorded before Anchor Bay had to drop the two-disc idea), when it actually isn't. The alternate endings, however, do provide the majority of the missing footage from the 1981 preview, save some small scenes/changes.

By its very nature, sex needs thrusting. More specifically, one part of the body must be in some form of friction with another. This isn't a very romantic way of thinking about it, but then again the MPAA isn't a very romantic organization. Their job is to count thrusts, and then decide, depending on the number, who should see the film. Nice work if you can get it.\"",

The Wolf Man was never to appear onscreen. Ultimately, the studio determined that Talbot's literal transformation into a werewolf would be more appealing to the audience and, thus, more profitable. The script was revised accordingly. The remake of the film starring Benicio Del Toro leaned into this idea, having its version of Lawrence Talbot be admitted to an asylum for \"delusions\" of lycanthropy.",

However, Laroquette was busy with \"Night Court\" (1984) and couldn't accept the role. Candy's good friend and frequent collaborator, John Hughes, then suggested Jeffrey Jones for the role, as Hughes had directed Jones in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986). Candy initially was hesitant because he felt the film would seem too much like a John Hughes film without the involvement of Hughes himself, but Hughes assured Candy that Jones was right for the role and he was cast.",

Stumbling upon a copy of \"If I Die Before I Wake,\" the novel upon which this film is based, Welles phoned Harry Cohn, instructing him to buy the rights to the novel and offering to write, direct and star in the film so long as Cohn would send $55,000 to Boston within two hours.

Nothing raises questions, other than who was murdered. We're also given no information on why we should care. Then it's a rewind to see a bit of bland backstory until we catch up with our murder again. Everything so far has only provided evidence that DEATH AT THE DINER is weak on storytelling.We did have a murder, so that proves the title is accurate at least. But does anything else interesting happen? Unfortunately, the episode doesn't improve after that and we end up with a dull slog all the way through until the end when the murderer is revealed.

It was really the late-'90s/early-2000s ones that I went to see in movie theaters, a lot of them on opening day as they came out. There's definitely a spiritual sort of through-line between those films and ours, but in terms of the way THERE'S SOMEONE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE looks, I was just excited to be able to take a more classical approach to styling a movie. I'd never had the chance, or had the time or the money to be able to craft a film visually in the way we were able to do with this one. I worked a lot with the DP, Jeff Cutter, in terms of thinking about what lenses we were going to use, and what the look was going to be, and it was thrilling to be able to craft the movie in a way that spoke to solving the problems of this individual project, as opposed to feeling like I had to throw in specific visual references to these other films you're talking about.\"",

Stop stealing actors and develop some actors for your series and movies.The parallels between the Teagarden series is way too obvious - instead of an old boyfriend being a detective to work with, she works with her brother and then, the book club, which was so over the top, again made me uncomfortable and they forced it on us that they were going to discuss the murder and help to solve it, of course putting Ainsley as their leader since she has a criminal investigation background, but couldn't handle the situation so moved out of Chicago to the country.

The case involved a man named Martin Guerre who, having disappeared from his Basque village in 1548, suddenly reappeared eight years later. Despite his slightly changed appearance, he convinced his family, wife, and fellow villagers that he was indeed Martin Guerre; he and his wife had two more children and he sued a paternal uncle for the claim to his father's estate. That uncle became suspicious that this returned Martin Guerre was actually an impostor named Arnaud du Tilh, and he contrived a way to have him tried for imposture. This suspicion was ultimately confirmed when the actual Martin Guerre arrived in court during du Tilh's trial. Arnaud du Tilh was convicted and hanged in September 1560.",

He was also the father of 5-year-old \"Mia Love Disnard\" whom he had with his baby mother. \"Mikey Madison\" played the role of \"River\", a single mother in Los Angeles who was also the lead star of the movie.

It was released in the European market, however Stanley has never seen this version. Stanley came to an agreement with the producers over a 95-minute compromise cut. At this point the film's British backers, Palace Pictures, went bust, making it increasingly unlikely that the film would ever see the light of day in a UK cinema. Then after about a year of frantic searching, Stanley discovered that the original negative was being held by PolyGram. He went to the film's original investors, Channel 4 and British Screen Finances, which were naturally keen to see what had happened to their investment. PolyGram was obliged to hand over the negative, which Stanley re-cut to his own specifications, and with his own money.",

In 1910, after reading in Mark 16:18 \"they shall take up serpents... and it shall not hurt them,\" former bootlegger George Went Hensley, aka \"Little George,\" took a rattlesnake box into the pulpit. He reached in and lifted out the venomous viper, showing his faith to take God at his Word. He then challenged his congregation to do the same. News spread throughout the hills of Grasshopper Valley in southeastern Tennessee. Before long, others joined in the handling of rattlers. The practice continued for ten years until one of the faithful died of a snakebite. Hensley moved to Harlan, Kentucky.",

            "storyline": "I think most people wanted to see a hot girl sword fighting in armor in medieval forests. That's all the poster's fault. As much as I hate formulas, movie posters are not art, they are templates designed to tell the viewer at a glance what kind of film you are giving them. In that regard, the poster was atrocious.Instead you get a slow paced thriller about a young woman traumatized by her mother's suicide when she was a child and the subsequent estrangement of her father. The film brings in a demonic force, but it's nothing more than a symbol of the past one must overcome in order to move forward and not a horror element. The actresses are beautiful and actors (all seven of them, perhaps with the exception of the child, but you know.., child actors) do a good job. The mood is appropriate and the sets well done. The film is rich in psychological symbols and I think for someone living similar (but non supernatural) situations, this could actually be therapeutic.All in all, for the type of movie it is, it's a pretty good movie. I agree that it could have packed more in less time, but sometimes, if you are in the mood, you can get into the atmosphere of a slow burning film and this is exactly that kind of film. If you are impatient to see sweaty chicks grunting while wielding heavy metal swords you will, of course, be disappointed. However, people that would identify with the main characters would actually benefit from the gradual exposure to possible triggers.Another aspect of the film that unfortunately took something from the overall experience was the fight scenes in the dark. You could barely understand what was going on. It's a small point, but also a relevant one.Addressing the lesbian elephant in the room, it was by no means woke, and it wove naturally into the plot. Did the film linger a bit too much on the personal relationships of the lead character so that absolutely nothing really happens in the first 45 minutes? Yes. But that has nothing to do with gender politics.All in all, I think the people that would have enjoyed the film were thrown off by the poster just as the people who would not have enjoyed were lured in by it. It is a good movie that I don't regret seeing, even if it wasn't really entertaining. Good acting and directing.",

In the summer of 1917, Frances Griffiths (then ten years old) and her cousin Elsie Wright (then sixteen years old) were living with Elsie's parents in the town of Cottingley in West Yorkshire. Using Arthur Wright's camera, the girls took a series of pictures of themselves with fairies in the nearby woodland brook of Cottingley Beck. (The woodland scenes in \"FairyTale: A True Story\" are filmed in Cottingley Beck, the actual location where Frances and Elsie supposedly encountered the fairies in 1917.) The photographs became public in 1919 (not during World War I, as depicted in the film), when Elsie's mother gave the photos to Edward Gardner, President of the Theosophical Society of Bradford. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published the photos with an article on spiritualism in \"The Strand\" Magazine in December 1920. Opinions over the authenticity of the photos were divided. Several photographic experts examined them and pronounced them \"genuine,\" while other photo experts found \"evidence of fakery.\" (A few experts who examined the photos noted that the \"fairies\" had \"Parisienne-style haircuts,\" which were popular in the day.) In the end, no real harm came from the photos. The two girls never accepted any money for them, or tried to swindle anyone with their claims of fairy encounters. Years later, as adults, the girls admitted they had faked the photos using cardboard cutouts of fairies taken from a children's book. Elsie explained that they were too embarrassed to admit the truth about the photos after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the legendary creator of Sherlock Holmes, accepted them as genuine. However, Frances insisted until her death that at least one of the \"fairy photos\" was real. Frances died in 1986, and Elsie died in 1988. The original photos, and the cameras the girls used to take them, are now in the National Media Museum in Bradford, England.",

Hitchcock quickly sent his cameras and actors out to Charing Cross Bridge to film the scene, but when the rushes came back from the developers, the scene at the bridge was nowhere to be found. Hitchcock and his assistants searched through the prints, but could not find it.

            "storyline": "Saw this at the Imagine 2024 film festival in Amsterdam, where it was the main course at the formal opening. Very strange story, impossible to condense in a few sentences, other than what the synopsis on various websites already tried to tell us about this movie.Kafka is referenced very often in the synopsis and reviews, and implicitly in the film title (Mr. K.) too. It is not bureaucracy being K's primary obstacle, but other people in the hotel, who are very happy the way it is now and don't want any change. The continuous drive K had to find the hotel exit, came initially from an early appointment he had the first day of his stay. Once he missed that, his urge to get out of the hotel persisted for no reason other than instinct.A variety of mysterious circumstances and events hinder him on his way out, one of which is an often-appearing marching band passing through the hallways, without any goal or purpose, if only to confuse us as well as Mr. K. The walls and wallpaper start crackling, later revealing some vegetation, maybe suggesting that the hotel is in fact an organism with a purpose of its own. More such extraneous things pass by, none of those really eerie, merely unusual or unexpected, by lack of better words to describe what happened. K's whereabouts in the hotel's kitchen are even stranger, but what it means, if anything, can better be left to an unprepared viewer.Quote: \"We didn't need an exit before you came.\" From early on, we see the word Liberator painted on the wall near K's hotel room, obviously meaning something, but we don't know the author nor the reason why K is appointed that role. One moment he is respected, nearly worshipped as their liberator, and a few scenes later he is chased and attacked for destroying the hotel and ending everyone's peaceful existence. Neither is true, of course, but we don't know the real truth either. Maybe the best parody on normal life is demonstrated in the kitchen, with a peculiar hierarchy, and a head chef who sees some talent in K, only to feel challenged by him later.The only objective evidence that unexplainable things are happening, and that the inhabitants cannot go on forever like they are used to, is the shrinking of the hotel rooms. We see the hotel guests cheerfully bringing their furniture to the corridor (which is also shrinking, but they do it anyway). Strangely enough, no inhabitant finds the shrinking building something to worry about. K's journey through the building lets us meet a variety of characters, all having their own role in defending the status quo as the way it should be, defying any changes.Quote: \"You look for the reception where you came into the hotel, to find the exit. Sometimes, the entrance is not the exit.\" (paraphrased). This comes from two wise-cracking elderly ladies, repeatedly offering him coffee and cake, seemingly in no way concerned about the world around them. They try to cheer up K, who is apparently in distress and deaf to their good-natured comments.All in all, if you want a deeper showcase for the behavior of people living happily in their comfort zone, only to be disturbed in their happy isolation, this is an interesting and entertaining story. The \"offender\" causing the disturbance is ridiculed as well as worshipped. Instead of Kafka's struggle with bureaucracy, this Mr. K. must overcome the natural resistance of average people who clinch their quiet and peaceful existence, and who also refuse so see a lurking danger that is obvious to us but not to them. You need an outsider to trigger change, or better said a revolution.",

Oh, and one little story that people might like: It was my first night there, I wasn't shooting but I was on the set to say hello to Phil Joanou, our director. Alec (Baldwin) had this scene where he had to jump into the water-pond, really-and swim across it. They're getting ready, they're all set up, Phil says, \"Here we go! Alec, you ready?\" \"Yeah!\" And suddenly alligator eyes appear on the water. Everybody freezes. \"There's a gator! Oh, my God!\" Alec says, \"It's cool. I'm going in.\" The stuntman goes, \"You're not going in!\" Alec says, \"Roll the camera!\" They roll the camera, Alec jumps in, crosses the pond, gets out. \"Okay, we got the shot?\" And we moved on. I couldn't believe it. He's got the balls of a dinosaur, dude. It was wild. True story! He really did that. It was cool!\"",

'About a Hero' is the result of that project. Winiewicz said Herzog's famous quote \"a computer will not create a film as good as mine in 4,500 years\" was partly the trigger for this project, and also a personal relationship with a former partner whom he only communicated via emails despite living together. It was around that time that Google introduced 'smart compose,' an algorithm that learns from your emails and it was able to predict your next words and sentences.

Andrew Jackson was quoted as saying, \"I would rather take on the entire English Fleet than stay one night at the Bell House,\" however his presence at the house is disputed and there are no official records that confirm he was actually present or witnessed any supernatural activity. The haunting is documented in M. V. Ingram's 1894 book, \"An Authenticated History of The Famous Bell Witch\". This movie was based on the book by Brent Monahan, \"The Bell Witch: An American Haunting the Famous Bell Witch\". However, the Ingram book has been called into question by researchers, who have noted that it's based on secondhand accounts and that no firsthand accounts to the haunting survive, and records from the time have not supported the story of the haunting. The Ingram book calls on quotes from letters and diaries but those documents no longer exist (if they ever did) and it is impossible to verify if the haunting actually happened or if it was a hoax or an early urban legend. Some researchers have even raised the possibility that the Ingram book was actually a work of fiction now mistakenly believed to be a factual account.",

            "storyline": "Certainly a must watch film for fans of the genre. The casting, cinematography, acting, scores and writing are all very good. There were only a couple things which held it back from being a true great.The first is that despite that it's a horror movie with an 18+ rating it isn't very scary at all. There are some good creepy elements here and there and the mood gets rather spooky from time to time but it never comes close to a full follow through and give you any dread or fear that you might come to expect with these types of films. Instead it's replaced with an element of mystery which does do a pretty good job of keeping you interested but very far away from being horrified.The next thing I took issue with is despite the frequency of sex scenes, you never see any 18+ nudity - now I'm not saying that from the viewpoint of one who seeks out films filled with cheap pornographic material from plastic actresses. The camera work, lighting and makeup takes a very cinematic approach - the actresses are made to look like real people you could encounter in the street - they have laugh lines and blemishes, their makeup isn't always done and their hair doesn't always look perfect but yet they are quite attractive none the less. It all comes together to create a sense of realism that's quite submersible and effective. But watching numerous sex scenes unfold without seeing a bare behind or even a bare breast make an appearance but instead two people making love and staying unnaturally fully covered I found created contrast to the otherwise realistic and raw tone the rest of the film seemed to adhere to. In short it just seemed out of place and offbeat and gave the feeling of something being missing from the experience.While the twist at the end was predictable and formulaic it didn't conclude the film in the exact way that I was expecting so i'll award half points for its conclusion. All in all I would certainly recommend that genre fans give it a watch - while it's not very scary it also doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and instead gives an honest effort towards creating a good atmospheric mystery with some horror elements and it's certainly worth your time.",

After that he was transferred in 1942 to the camp of Drancy and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau where he would die.\nAlthough all of these traits are shared by the character of André Korben, it is to be noted that the passion for supernatural and spirits belong only to the fictional character, as it is not documented that Bernard Natan shared those interests at all.",

They typically take on the appearance of a beautiful woman in the trees who lures men into secluded forests to kill them and steal their vitality. A woman who returns as a Churel is said to target the male members of her former family first, in order to get revenge.\nWithin Hindu belief, Churels may become into dakinis (flesh eating female demons/ demi gods) and serve the goddess Kali, joining the goddess' routine in feasting on human flesh and blood.",

I think this is really insensitive and had someone taken the Korean historical War and written an inaccurate spin on it, it would have been extremely offensive. This movie is and would be to every Lebanese.First of all the movie wasn't even filmed in Lebanon. And BTW Lebanon looked much prettier during the Civil War than it does today, the country wasn't as ruined back then as it is today. Yet it shows Lebanon as a totally ruined desert. And there wasn't even any Lebanese-speaking actor besides one I think, the accent was far off from what a Lebanese accent. It's a shame really but I guess that was why the film wasn't filmed in Lebanon because it would probably have caused problems for the production team if they didn't get their facts straight about what happened during the Civil War.But I guess I may have enjoyed the movie more had it not been for the fact that I'm Lebanese and actually know about what the Civil War was like.",

Water is very important, as it is a highly visible medium in its many forms (including within or from underneath a surface), and it is necessary, sensual, and enjoyable, but also dangerous (the drowning), and evokes many emotions. Flowing water can also symbolize the passage of time. The dynamic of children relating to adults, not understating them or their actions, while seeing them as role models, is another dichotomy the director wanted to emphasize. Ambiguity and a 'dream-like' quality are also important elements of the film. She states they digitally enhanced or 'tweaked' colors in the film to 'non-realistic' tones, to achieve mood and lighting effect, particularly day for night shots. The director says she is not interested in explaining meaning: \"... what I like in cinema is being lost. I like films I don't completely understand, so they stay with me longer after they're over,\" and, \"I believe everyone can find their own stories within the film.\"",

Filming was completed in the early part of 1966, but its American release was not until late 1967, and its British one not until the spring of 1968. David Hemmings made this movie before his breakthrough role in Blow-Up (1966), and it is quite possible that the great (and unexpected) popularity of that movie was what finally pushed MGM into releasing this one. Many commented with surprise on the smallness of Hemmings' role - it is likely that his special billing, along with that of Sharon Tate, was an afterthought to disguise the fact that they had supporting parts. Although this movie was supposed to launch Tate, she had, because of its protracted shelf-life, already been seen in Don't Make Waves (1967), which she had made subsequently. That movie has a special \"introducing\" credit for her as a result.",

This one isn't scary either but I do think it's intelligent, respects its viewer and is made with passion instead of a cash grab project.Definitely recommended, it takes its time to build a proper story, to include the viewer, to make him question what's happening on the screen and also offers a good ending. So head to toes, a lovely experience here.Cheers!",

In his book, Something Like an Autobiography, Akira Kurosawa described Honda's role stating, \"I had Honda do mainly second-unit shooting. Everyday I told what I wanted and he would go out into the ruins of postwar Tokyo to film. There are few men as honest and reliable as Honda. He faithfully brought back exactly the footage I requested, so almost everything he shot was used in the final cut of the film. I'm often told that I captured the atmosphere of postwar Japan very well in Stray Dog, and if so I owe a great deal of that success to Honda.\"",

A whole town not caring about a Seoul girl? Found this hard to believe from the first scene. From the first scene, if you want to leave your critical mind out, you will love this movie which tackles so many issues in today's world such as abuse of girls.There are many scenes which make you want to leave, particularly towards the end. Still, the setting up of the villains as predatory makes us appreciate at least the effort of the moviemakers. The main issue is that you are able to predict what will happen next easily, especially in a small village like this.The Don Lee's nature of muscling away thugs in the action scenes are repetitive for normal people, yet a treat for his fans and those who buy into the plot of this average movie. Still, the blind eye shown to such issues by the villagers will make you feel strongly for the cause this character crusades for. The solving of the crime is not thrilling like a Sherlock Holmes film.Even with all these defects, the alluring nature of the village and the way the movie reveals the accounts of different people in a confusing puzzle at least helps one feel something big is about to happen. In the end, this does happen and the biggest criminals are brought down by the seemingly normal people, who are often abused by those in power. This is all a normal person watching a movie asks for and is gifted in this delightful treat.",

I guess it was a split decision in that moment on my part that I at least maintain my professionalism so I stayed in the scene. Kinski was way out of line. I don't think we shot that over and I think that scene is in the film also in the moment of what was going on.\"",

When he talks it feels like theres a weird tension.Lead girl : 7/10. Can actually act. Some scenes felt weird though. But overall ok.The main detective : 9/10 imo. Can switch up characters just like that.",

It was estimated that a lot of people went to see the film without knowing that this is an art house film. This resulted in major backlash as netizens complained against the film, as well as calling the ones who appreciated it \"jia wenyi (phony-artistic)\".

He became so passionate about it that he solved it wherever he went from parties to shoots to meetings. Since he is known to be a method actor and a perfectionist who believes in going through his paces beforehand, he began learning to unlock the puzzle much before the film hit the floors. He tagged the cube along with him everywhere and practiced it in his free time - in his car, at theaters or even in his office. And reportedly, very soon he became such an expert at it that he now throws challenges at others to beat him at it.",

This caught the attention immediately and kept me on the edge of the seat. It goes slow thereafter bringing various twists and turns during the course of the story. A greedy and mafia money lender, a brilliant but unemployed friend, mechanic friend and girlfriend. It gives various dimension to the story. But these dimensions and twists/turns makes the movie a little slow and slightly lengthy. The casting was wonderful and has some excellent dialogue (I took help of subtitle). The ending too has a sweet twist. Overall great performances, casting, music, screenplay. You will not regret seeing once.",

The psychologist caring for him tells him that he is the sole survivor and that his sister hasn't been seen since those events. She encourages him to try to remember just what happened while he is also undergoing physiotherapy. Gradually he, and we, learn just what happened that day.I thought this was a decent drama. It is fairly slow burn and doesn't provide as many surprises as I suspects its makers think. I'm sure most viewers will have suspected how it will end long before the 'big reveal'. That said it managed to keep me interested throughout. The cast is solid, especially Txomin Vergez, who plays Thomas. There is a good atmosphere with limited settings giving it an almost theatrical feel at times. Overall a solid enough film; not a must see but worth a watch if you are a fan of French films.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",

Lin does a good job on approaching the themes of the one-child policy effect, the character's personalities and ambitious, and the settings the narrative is exploring with. China's one-child policy is an interesting and difficult topic to explore and the movie does a good job on handling it's themes and style with the writing that feels interesting and engaging.The camerawork, production, and the sound designs are really good and there were certain colorful choices that reminded me a lot of Wong Kar-wai in a good way. Many of the performances are pretty good as there are good family dynamics explored within one another.The soundtrack and sound designs are good, the dialogue, while at times feel a little clunky, the visual presentations, and the camerawork is simply gorgeous to look at. There were a few certain aspects on the narrative that were a little strange but overall, I really liked it.Art-house Chinese movies from Mainland China are not often discussed and I love to see more Chinese filmmakers branching out into the art-house world.",

Judging by the cover (of the soundtrack) and the music itself, I thought that I was about to watch something completely different.Anyway, I think that Svidd Neger has its value (even though most people, like myself, will experience a lack comprehension about what's going on almost the entire movie) mainly because it is rich in cultural values, stereotypes and even a sense of humor that I've never being in touch with, and I guess that for that reasons only, it can please some audiences.",

Each version contains a few shots or lines that are missing from the other two. Because this movie was taken out of Welles' control in post-production, it will never be known exactly what he had in mind for the complex flashback structure of which he spoke later in his life. \"The Comprehensive Version\", which airs on Turner Classic Movies, runs one hour 47 minutes.",

Later, however, the decision was made to film it as a regular horror film with the less erotic title \"Count Yorga, Vampire\" . This name change explains the poor animation of the name \"Count Yorga\" in the film's title as it now appears on-screen. The original title and original Iorga spelling were both restored to the film by the 1990s, but all prints of it were still identical to the original 1970 release. Apparently, no additional footage survives from its original porn version of it at all and it is unknown if said version was actually filmed or, if it was filmed, whether or not it was finished or even released if it was (it is worth noting, however, that the characters often pronounce the Count's name within the film as \"Iorga\" (ee-yor-ga) and not as \"Yorga\" (yor-ga)).",

Janine Chang is a really good actress and I think that she should appear in TV Series and movies of the West. Nevertheless, I cannot say the same for Chloe Xiang because she is really overacting and it is obvious. The atmosphere of this movie is a bit depressive and if you are suicidal, you should stay away from this movie. I give 5 points out of 10 for this one because of it's ending.

The sponsors also emphasized that the money wasn't PHYSICALLY hidden anywhere, lest anyone injure themselves or damage property while searching for the loot. The audience just had to GUESS where the money was hidden. Ticket buyers were even given game cards shaped like American currency, with a big photo of Dino De Laurentiis where the President should be. (The money was hidden in the bridge of the Statue of Liberty's nose.) In the end, it was a big disaster for the studio. The film was one of the major flops of the 1980s, barely grossing a million dollars at the box office, which the studio wound up forking over to the contest winner: a woman in Bakersfield, California.",

Chandler turned the script in on time. Many now believe the drunkenness was simply a ruse by Chandler to wrangle extraordinary privileges from the desperate studio.",

There was no actual back and forth dialogue, there was only different people saying lines out loud. There was no acting, so that wasn't what he wanted to showcase. It wasn't the special effects and chase scenes that he wanted to show off. There was no horror, only awkward squealing while people tolerated this guy playing dress-up, playing with his fun new voice distortion toy and dancing around like he thought he was a pretty pretty princess.The only thing more dangerous than the genius level methodical/strategic serial killers out there are the narcissistic man boys playing pretend and desperately trying out to live out their fantasies with an audience. Why? Because they snap when they don't get recognition for being the gods they vehemently know they are - and then, in a fit of rage at the injustice of the world not agreeing with their narcissism, they actually run breathy, sweaty and wobbling out into the night to do the things they always dreamed about doing to all those women that rejected them, but with none of the intelligence, restraint or psychosis of their heroes.Because that's what this was.

Harlow saved the day by insisting on sharing the suite with Loy: \"That mix-up brought me one of my most cherished friendships,\" Loy said in \"Being and Becoming\", her autobiography. \"You would have thought Jean and I were in boarding school we had so much fun. We'd stay up half the night talking and sipping gin, sometimes laughing, sometimes discussing more serious things.\" Meanwhile, Powell got the hotel's one remaining room--a far humbler accommodation downstairs.",

            "storyline": "It's about how the perfect life of a strict and tough rhythmic gymnastics teacher of competition begins to escape out of her hands. Caída Libre\", is an Universal Pictures film starring Belén Rueda and produced by J. A Bayona, it burst into sixth place with a box office take of 124,748 euros. Marisol (Belén Rueda) is a domineering, suffocating, manipulative and very demanding woman. She always has everything under control. In her work as coach of the Olympic rhythmic gymnastics team, she is methodical and extremely demanding, where perfection and being the first is the only thing that counts. Marisol tyrannically and cruelly trains the young rhythmic gymnast Angelica (Mariia Netavrovana). Her whole life is continuously regulated and in her personal life she is obsessed with every detail, even the relationship with her husband (Ilay Kurelovic). But when things start to go wrong, her self-destruction explodes. Marisol knows she is failing and that is something she cannot allow. How far can someone like that go?A fluid and very luxurious visual style movie, and a story of personal rediscovery of a woman who must break down to rebuild herself and find out who she is. JA Bayona produces this uncomfortable and tense dramatic thriller influenced by films such as ¨Tar¨, ¨Whiplash¨ or ¨Black Swan¨ in which Belén Rueda as the absolute protagonist develops tour-of-force acting. She gives a good performance as a perfectionist, tyrant, narcissistic woman who hides, under this facade, a great insecurity. The actress continues to prove herself to be one of the best performers in our country with each film -although quite aged, she is almost sixty years old- , capable of an impressive versatility in which she knows how to give life to each character with elegance and a lot of talent. Without her, surely, Caída libre (Freen falling, international title) would not be the film that it is and it would not work, because to believe the story we need to believe Marisol, and to believe Marisol we need Belén Rueda, for everything that the character contains, for her many edges. Because she is a character who is unsympathetic because of how she treats others, but who hides an insecurity that leads her to a pathos with which we all empathize. Belén is an actress expert on mystery and terror films , such as : Julia's eyes , The orphanage , No dormirás , Durante la tormenta , El cuaderno de Sara, el Pacto, Orbita 9 , and The body . Resulting to be an adequate and decent movie , but inferior than other Belén Rueda's mysterious films .The cast is completed by Mariia Netavrovana as the Ukrainian gymnast who is subjected to continuous abuse, Irene Escolar as an even more sensitive and intelligent coach, Ilay Kurelovic as the bored hubby, Brays Efe as a nurse, and Manuela Vellés as the hubby's lover who causes our protagonist to have a deep nervous breakdown when she finds out about her husband's adultery.In her second feature film, filmmaker Laura Jou explores the limits of a peculiar character as extreme, abusive and with as many edges as Marisol, a woman full of dark internal struggles who after building her world to measure now collapses resulting in fateful consequences. It features careful and colorful photography from cameraman Marc Gómez del Moral , as well as thrilling and sensitive musical score by composer Clara Peya. A sufficiently enjoyable film as a whole, even if the script is not well-rounded and has a disappointing ending. The director Laura Jou is an actress and acting coach. Laura is protégé of J. A. Bayona and she had previously directed a single film: Life Without Sara Amat , as well as shorts and episodes of TV series: Cucut and Fácil. Rating Free falling: 6/10. The film will appeal to Belén Rueda fans.",

Though the initial buildup to story was slow burning and looked interesting... Acting was best level from the leads but FAHAD role was a damp squib and not sure why he accepted such a role unless he owes a movie to the director .... While the main was to take a thriller u cannot do any nonsense and something which does not make any sense showing some 20% and leaving 80% for audience imagination which is illogical... Overall a highly boring thriller movie from a good crew.",

Reher, Chapel starts with Cohen Black (Jeremy Sumpter) waking up in a hospital, unsure of who he is, where he's been and why a fisherman found him nearly drowned five months ago. He's helped by a nurse named Sofia Bloome (Pardis Saremi) to learn who he really is and what the name Ethan Tucker means. Filmed in Utah, this movie is referred to as a country crime thriller. Once Cohen wakes up, he becomes a suspect in a serial murder case and followed by Detective Wyatt. He also has a series of memories that flood back in which he is surrounded by a table of women, which includes Grace Veum (Taryn Manning). Whatever the past is, Cohen is drawn to a rundown motel where he meets 10 o'Clock Jack (Lochlyn Munro) and despite his relationship with Sofia, he falls for a girl named Misha (Carol Anne Watts).For a direct to Tubi movie that was dumped in January this is better than I was expecting. The premise for the first half of the movie is actually intriguing and Courtney Paige as a director was actually able to make this seem like a semi professional movie with good shots and directing throughout. Unfortunately the longer this movie goes on the more confusing and convoluted it gets. Jeremy Sumpter as the lead came off good in some scenes and poor in others. The script for this movie ultimately needed more work because like I said the longer this movie goes on the more confusing and convoluted it gets which I'm sure wasn't the intention. But overall compared to most other Tubi movies this was at least watchable and had a strong first half. I'm intrigued to see what Courtney Paige does next as a director.",

They have very little substance and they are pretty much the generic my boyfriend is stalking/trying to kill me fare.My previous viewing of the Hulu documentary, \"Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence,\" piqued my curiosity. Billy Zane solidified it. Whatever he's in, Zane literally eats up every scene. And he doesn't disappoint even in a Lifetime movie, he delivers one of the best method acting turns the channel has ever or will see. He's literally unhinged but not in a campy way. In short, his effort including significant weight gain is Emmy worthy or at least worth a viewing.Besides Zane's acting, the script is lightweight, typical of Lifetime. And that's disappointing because the story of this cult is gripping.",

Now they are valuable enough, but somehow our sleuth reckons there is much more to it, and when the legendary \"Kaito Kid\" - usually noted for his jewel thievery - is seen at the scene, the game is well and truly afoot. We've got a generous (and duplicitous) millionaire vying with our investigators and the white caped-kid as the clues start to suggest that the swords could form a code that will lead the way to a secret weapon that could spell doom for the whole nation. Can our intrepid team thwart this evil intent in time? I like these animated stories. Though this one is a little on the long side, and there's a rather annoying romance cluttering things up from time to time, there are plenty of characters to suspect, we are given an inclusive idiots guide to crime-fighting and are led down plenty of blind alleys and shown loads of red herrings whilst the animators deliver some fast-moving sword fights, flying acrobatics and airborne escapades the length and breadth of Japan. I found the ending to be a bit weak, but I like the idea of us all using our little grey cells to sort out a problem that marries crime with history, mystery and myth.",

I spent years looking for a decent copy of this film, and all this time remained under the assumption that it was one of the last great gialli that I hadn't seen yet. Alas, after the derivative but nevertheless atmospheric and promising opening sequences, the film turns into a bizarre smorgasbord of trash, sleaze and murder, but ... not the good kind! Six people are invited into the remote gothic castle of a married couple, much against the will of the husband and the eerie house servant. The oppressed wife - Marialé - takes them to the cellars where she has an odd collection of mannequin dolls with medieval costumes, and shortly after, the whole group indulges into an extended and dreadfully boring orgy without sex but with crazy role-plays instead. These masquerade sequences are overlong, implausible and utterly senseless. Only in the last half hour, the guests are being murdered one by one and shortly after another, but the outcome (as in: the identity of the culprit) is so incredibly obvious that you wonder what the point of the whole masquerade was. The murders are unimaginative and as good as bloodless, with the notable exception of one person being bludgeoned to death in a pool. To finish off with at least a few positive words, the soundtrack is sublime, the women are beautiful, and there are some good performances by respectable Italian genre veterans (Ivan Rassimov, Luigi Pastili, ...)",

A scene with Bobby running up the stairs was left half-completed at the end of the week's shooting on a Friday evening. Over the weekend, Madeleine decided the boy needed a haircut, and when he returned to the set on Monday, it was impossible to match the remaining shots they needed to the ones taken a few days before. The Make-up Department tried attaching hair pieces to him, but it didn't look right. Reed was furious and had no choice but to rearrange the shooting schedule to complete the stair scene after Bobby's hair grew out. \"It's the most expensive haircut in the world!\" Reed groused. \"Thousands of pounds! That's what it will cost!\" The incident was the only delay in an otherwise smooth shoot, which ended up completing on schedule.",

Among the better elements with this one is the solid small-town murder mystery that serves as the main setup of the whole feature. The central plotline involving the group of friends coming together at the behest of their returning friend trying to set everything right during the holiday season which serves to set off a series of killings around the town that are directly tied to her arrival makes everything appear quite enjoyable overall. The small-town history involving a history of murders taking place in the town that includes a series of unraveling clues pointing to a figure from it's past come back to life and starting a new spree over everything is all handled nicely enough as the clues lead to a killer directly targeting members of the specific community. Even with this factor being taken into account, the whole setup coming into a rather cohesive conclusion adds nicely to the overall presentation which is a great time here. This one also manages to bring together a fairly solid series of brutal and generally enjoyable stalker set pieces that are handled rather nicely. The opening setup that turns out to be a recreation of one of the stories from the podcast she hosts is an impressive enough time as the case reveal comes off nicely after the stalking and brutal murder that starts everything. The regular stalking here, done at the hands of the Santa-dressed killer, are generally quite fun, resulting in either the sudden shock ambush that ends in a brutal kill or the grim aftermath of everything when they stumble upon everything. With there being a lot to like about it, the only real issue with this one is the generally predictable setup that results from operating in such familiar territory where so much of this one is hammered home by the slasher formula. It's not truly detrimental or damaging but does stand out as a factor against this one.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

The film follows two law enforcement officials as they investigate a woman who kills eleven people in a Church shooting. As disturbing details come to light, it begins to appear that the Devil is closer than you think.There is an eerie feeling to the movie because the story successfully meshes the Devil to a mass shooting. With such shootings now commonplace across the US, the premise could be truer than you think. Dean Cain, Natasha Henstridge and AnnaLynne McCord all give great performances which elevate the script. The intense and twisty nature of the story demands intense performances from the cast who do not disappoint. It is good to see both Cain and Henstridge in more features after they disappeared from our screens not too long ago. Natasha Henstridge has a knack for playing potent villains and here, her villainous turn is both menacing and memorable.The grimdark cinematography is completely in line with the tone of the story while the violence is both shocking and brutal. Such dark and gloomy crime thrillers with a religious aspect are now a rarity in Hollywood these days so it is great to see a story that dives into the Devil-ish aspects of how crimes are committed.Tense, gripping and potent, Condition of Return is a well made crime thriller that ticks all the right boxes. The film has an impressive cast, an interesting premise and good execution all of which combines into a visceral experience.",

Like more psychological thriller than horror... Now the hook of the film is that it's based on an urban legend of a haunted painting. That didn't come in until like the 15th draft. I could probably make 10 different versions of this movie that don't even look alike... It took about 3 or 4 years, and trying to get enough money. When you're making an original movie that in the 3rd act, it doesn't go like torture porn or Saw (2004), it goes like Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman, that's NOT a recipe for people wanting to throw money at you. But it was sticking to our guns and I felt like that was what I wanted to do.\"",

While Strange Illusion is by no means completely faithful to the original Shakespeare story-line - the character Ophelia doesn't exist here, and the tragic finale is replaced with a happy ending. In any case, Ulmer's film remains a fascinating attempt at re-imagining Shakespeare's Hamlet. Here, he is young Paul who lives in bucolic Southern California next to exclusive private schools and toney country clubs. To this, the plot adds a bit more - the protagonist admits himself into an insane asylum. This allows time for our scheming director Edgar G. Ulmer to amp up the cinematic tension, with added touches and moody lighting effects.",

Watching with Western eyes, I first saw Faust's Goethe, then a bit of Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose.But fortunately, I also enjoy Feng Shui...Wait.. what?I'll explain, I studied a PhD that looked at cognitive theory, and rather than go down the old NLP the map is not the territory road...I'll remind those who know that Sigmund Freud, after studying as a neurologist (I am also a rare bookseller and I once sent a copy of Freud's PhD thesis on neurology to a Chinese American in New York... but that's another story, and this film is Japanese, a different country)... but after training as a medical doctor, Sigmund Freud trained with the hypnotist, or mesmerist, Charcot.And then found that his clients 'recovered' just as well by talking through their symptoms without hypnosis.But he had to write a book on the Interpretation of Dreams first to get there.Today, modern athletes train hard to win a 100m race, but at least some get taught visualisation where they run through the race in their minds first.Therapists who work with veterans and those who have other traumas in the form of PTSD work with both grounding techniques, but also ways of working with imagery to understand their trauma better. The German for 'dream' is Traum!So, with that, I work with different mind maps, I work with a Hindu Vedic compass sometimes called a Brahma map as well as the Moksha Patam, as well as forms of hand meditation called Mudras.And so I also use Greek, Norse, and Chinese myths, as well as gods and goddesses from Hindu religion, as ways of contemplating my own mind.In Japanese myths, I like the spring story of Yazume and. Aretamasu, as she seduces the sun goddess out of her depression every year to bring in the new season.Not so different to St Antoine's Temptation, except St Antoine (bless him) is terrified.A story told in of all things Victor Hugo's story Les Miserables, where the two barricades are St. Antoine and the Temple, the former noisy, the latter quiet.So I use Feng Shui in my home, and I know some of the stories of the five elements, the different dragons (I have a statue of Hestia on my hearth, the home of the Golden Dragon) with the Black Tortoise, Vermilion Dragon, White Tiger and Jade Dragon at each compass point.So, I came to this film with some knowledge, and whilst the story is very much of a Japanese/ Chinese bent (I couldn't quite tell, but as a child, I watched the Water Margin and Monkey, Chinese myths made by Japanese filmmakers...), although I disappeared to Tarkovsky's Solaris for a 'madeleine' moment after the tale of the water under the CapitalWell, let's just say the film transported me on a fantastic journey through my unconscious, much known to me, but then, well, I was shown parts of the 'room' I didn't always look at.What else do you want from such a film?",

The holiday theme adds a nice seasonal touch, and the special manages to deliver a few chuckles with its holiday-centric antics.However, the special doesn't quite live up to the original film's appeal. The plot feels thin and less engaging, relying on recycled jokes and predictable scenarios that didn't capture the same freshness as before. The characters, while familiar, don't have the same depth or development as in the original, making their interactions feel more superficial. Additionally, the special's shorter runtime limits its ability to build a meaningful or memorable story.In summary, The Boss Baby Christmas Special is a decent holiday diversion with some of the original film's charm but falls short in both creativity and depth, making it feel like an inferior extension of the franchise.",

When filmmakers, or more precisely storytellers, do not have direct experience in the field in which they are narrating, they have an obligation to research - and research the ass out of the subject. When they fail to do that, they fail in creating a world in which audiences can suspend their disbelief. There is simply no excuse for laziness in scene setting or character presentation especially when audiences are far more historically clued up. So, for anyone who's interested, just watch the first 4.5 mins and observe......\n1) uniforms have staybrite buttons. They should be brass. Such a small detail isn't hard to get right. Buttons of the era up to WW2 (any will do as you're unlikely to see insignia detail) are freely and widely available online. Staybrite are horrible and shout modernity.2) Our officer, the Lieutenant interacts with a Corporal (stripes on his left arm) referring to him as 'Captain'.....twice just in case you think you misheard it.....3) The 'Captain' offers up a salute to the Lt first - not the way its done. You salute the rank, not the man. If indeed he was a Captain the Lt would have come to a smart attention and offered up the salute to the new arrival.It's pretty basic stuff to get right to be fair. The script is just plain awful if the actors are regurgitating what's on the page. And it's not the first film I've seen in the low budget war genre that has made this simple error..........and there's a lot more wrong here that I could labour on with. But to keep it short when you don't have much in the way of budget you have to make the most of what you do have. Be less pompous, cut the narrative back and tell a simple story well. War-set stories are ones where scrimping on accuracy simply isn't the way to best present your story and keep your audience engaged.",

Martin Scorsese also signed on as executive producer, and a cast (most of whom were in the final product) was assembled. Following creative disputes between USA and Koontz, both Koontz and Scorsese left the project (Scorsese was later convinced to return). Koontz and Anderson later developed the concept into a series of novels (as \"Dean Koontz' Frankenstein\"), but Koontz allowed USA to use the names of his characters as long as they altered the plot and removed his name from all consideration.",

The long pan-outs of scenery and mugging for the camera are beyond superfluous. And without spoilers, I pretty much \"got\" who Alexander was after their third interaction (yes...it was that predictable). The one good thing I can say is the filmography is well done and ranges from the hand-held/shaky technique to give the air of tension to some very elaborate shots which must have required some expensive equipment. In fact, I seriously don't know how the producer got the money to create this movie with such polish (then again, this is a Canadian film, so I'm sure they got a public grant for their required quota of gay films per year). If you have an hour to kill, watch this movie with a remote control so you can fast-forward through the slow parts...you'll need it.",

I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it though.Writers Michael Hurst and Chris Sivertson put together an amazingly generic, montonous and slow paced narrative for director Martin Wood to bring to the screen. The storyline in \"Double Life\" was so slow paced that it was a struggle to sit through it, and the fact that nothing interesting happened, just made it even more mind-numbing to sit through the ordeal. The concept of the storyline sounded interesting, for sure, but the execution from script to screen was just horrible.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in \"Double Life\", aside from actor Niall Matter, and he was hardly even in the movie. The actresses and actors in the movie, however, had very little contents to work with and bring to the script in terms of script, storyline, characters and dialogue.If you enjoy crime thrillers, then do yourself a favor and don't waste 89 minutes on the generic movie that is named \"Double Life\". There are far better crime thrillers out there.My rating of \"Double Life\" lands on a three out of ten stars.",

            "storyline": "It's essentially a ⭐⭐⭐ movie but an extra ½ to the makers (especially, director Shahi Kabir) for creating a fascinatingly little but intense atmosphere. The wireless station where the story takes place is said to be at an altitude of over 3,200 feet. Writers (Shaji Marad, Nidhish G) place the two leads (Soubin Shahir & Sudhi Koppa) at the top of a hill that's notorious for its deaths by lightning strikes. The first half is leisurely paced, giving us some incredible views of the surroundings, a few visitors, and the two cops' daily routines (that include eating, drinking, playing cards, and updating statuses through a wireless system).I'm a big fan of minimalist setups and fewer characters in stories, especially because they often prove to be intricate character studies from a psychological perspective. At 100 minutes, the writing is also tasked with the responsibility of including a murder investigation which begins as a sub-plot but slowly turns into an integral component. Therefore, the latter half is focused around making the twists, turns, and mind games work. They largely do, and credit for that should go to the performances from both Soubin and Sudhi. Once the uneasiness sets in, the film tightly holds onto it all the way to the finish. The weather elements (sudden winds, fogging, rains, lightning) also add an essential layer.The sound design (Ajayan Adat), cinematography (Manesh Madhavan), and background score (Anil Johnson) truly make the experience unmissable. The only issue I felt is that some of the dialogues in the climactic portion get drowned out by the score/noise. Nonetheless, the film is a triumph in the storytelling, performances, and atmosphere-building departments.",

There might be some interesting plot twists waiting ahead, but I felt from the beginning that it looks like fantasy that looks like a farce in costume, or a comedy that isn't even funny. The voice and action of the witch character was extremely annoying. Cinderella and red-hood girl exchanged some boring scripts. Then another annoying character popped up, looking like an angel or something. I couldn't stand watching it anymore. It's boring and isn't funny or interesting in anyway. The costume looks fancy alright but that doesn't enough to get me through. So I just write my experience and opinion as being from someone who couldn't manage to watch this movie to the end.",

He claims that Garbo personally told him she would only do the film with him as her leading man. After negotiations with both Garbo and Cukor fell through (Garbo never made another film, and Cukor was replaced by Henry Koster and he and Burton never worked together), Burton remained attached to the project, which was re-fashioned as a vehicle for Olivia de Havilland. Burton claims that de Havilland was impossibly arrogant following her recent Oscar win for The Heiress (1949), insisted on having sole above-the-title billing, and would not allow anyone to address her by her first name, only by \"Miss de Havilland\". He found this state of affairs preposterous and was rude about her for the rest of his life whenever the film (which he also disliked) came up in interviews.",

            "storyline": "\"Smoke Screen\" is a Lifetime TV movie from 2010 starring Jaime Pressly, Currie Graham, Garwin Sanford, and Larissa Laskin. Writing that it's a Lifetime movie and then adding it was made in Canada is redundant, but there you go.Pressly is Britt Shelley, a beautiful blond news reporter. One morning she wakes up and there's a dead man in bed with her. Naturally the police suspect her immediately, and poor Britt can't remember a thing past a certain point. She's positive she was slipped a date rape drug. She explains to the police detectives that a man who was involved in a fire she covered five years ago, Jay (Martin Cummins) wanted to speak with her. They meet at a restaurant; he has something important to tell her. After that, she's clueless until she wakes up next to his dead body.A city firefighter whose career was ruined by Britt due to the incident five years earlier, Raley (Currie Graham) kidnaps her and takes her to his cabin. Raley points out that he was set up the exact same way as Britt: he woke up with a woman in his bed, and the last thing he remembered was her offering him a drink at a party. The two investigate and realize the two cases are connected, and that someone is out to get Britt.This film didn't hold together all that well, and I figured out whodunit pretty soon after it started. It's a little slow, the romance seemed implausible, and Currie Graham was a distraction because he reminded me so much of Kevin Spacey. I actually thought there were too many characters and different parts of the original crime didn't come together well; if it had been directed better, we could have seen the plots gel more succinctly, but as it was, it was all over the place.Jaime Pressly did an okay job; she looks like your ideal soap opera actress, and the rest of the acting was passable. Just an okay film. Writing okay and Lifetime movie is redundant. But there you go.",

Peter and Angela wished to close the series occurring in Ireland. During the twelve years of the CBS series, many story plots and scenarios had been set in Ireland. Set in Ireland, second unit filming always was organized to film establishing exterior buildings, landscapes, an automobile driving on country lanes with matching vehicles filmed in conjunction of the movie's local Los Angeles exteriors. This last project gave an excuse for Angela and Peter to film the Ireland inserted establishing shots after filming was completed at Universal Studios. After these exterior Ireland street establishing insert shots were completed, the editors completed and delivered the finished two hour special to CBS. Filmed during 2002, the last \"Murder, She Wrote\" aired in 2003, after Peter Shaw's death in January 29, 2003. This movie was dedicated as a memorial to Peter Shaw Pullen.",

There is nothing enjoyable here, too bleak/sad/disturbing. This is how serial killer Ted Bundy spent a day of his life, having a psychotic break. There are positive things here, i mean, this movie takes you to a journey into Bundy's mind. Camera focuses on the victims, not him, but there is nothing voyeuristic here. It's just raw and real. This movie doesn't glorify serial killers as many other movies do. It shows you the truth, the ugliness, nothing charming here, it's a movie about the victims not the monsters. It made me uncomfortable to say the least. And i didn't like it, i was not ready for this. It looked more like a documentary or like a FOUND FOOTAGE than a \"normal\" movie. It gets a bit satisfying in the end, when it shows some shots from the actual Bundy trial. But overall, it was too disturbing for me.There is zero entertainment value here but if you find it interesting as it was described, you might like it more than me. It's a journey into the heart of darkness. I got goosebumbs when i realise what the title THE BLACK MASS actually means. It's not a sick movie like so many movies, it doesn't \"idolize\" serial killers and that's a good thing but still, if i knew what this is about, i would have never watched it.",

The movie clearly counts on its plot and its actors to maintain your interest; the plot does, but it's nothing brilliant (there are, after all, only two suspects for the killings), apart maybe from the killing method, which is indeed quite unique. The actors are clearly the best thing about \"Flirting With Danger\", and provide some eye-candy (for both sexes). Charisma Carpenter, one of the most uniquely beautiful actresses out there, with a smile that's at once sweet and naughty, plays the main suspect / love interest for the hero James Thomas, and Victoria Sanchez gives an appealing and believable performance as his childhood friend who may have deeper feelings for him. Despite his dilemma (or should that be trilemma - Karen Cliché is also around, as the other suspect), Thomas is a lucky man - but will he live long enough to enjoy his luck? You probably know the answer to that one, but \"Flirting With Danger\" is still an OK way to pass 90 minutes. (**)",

The problem is that they didn't include the audience. A movie can be a lot of things; smart, angry, dijointed, simplistic, action packed, erotic, whatever.... But doesn't it still have to be appealing? Otherwise what's the point?Trust me. Whatever underlying tones or metaphors are present with this movie will not be reached by hardly anyone. And I would contest that those who claim to understand what's going on with this movie are fooling you and themselves.These art movies can continue to be produced the way they are. That's fine and even great, but give the audience a payoff, or something. Anything at all. This movie doesn't deliver anything for the effort you will put into watching it.",

In terms of action, the whole film takes place on a farm in the countryside (Lower Austria), the actors are all very convincing and were well chosen. Pia Hierzegger is of course fantastic as the aunt, very believable.The label horror film is too strong for me, although it certainly fits into the genre, but measured against today's usual horror films, the film is already rather harmless, more psychological thriller. Also, the film offers little surprising.The story: overweight teenager Simi visits aunt Claudia, a nutrition expert, in the countryside (with hopes to be helped with dieting), with (newly married) uncle Stefan and cousin Fillip (from the first marriage of the aunt). Simi feels uncomfortable from the beginning, the cousin a creep, the aunt strict, the uncle too nice?I felt they got inspired by films like \"Get Out,\" \"The Wicker Man,\" as well as some Hammer films from the sixties. Without giving more away, you definitely guess what the whole thing is leading up to in the course of the film. That's what I meant by unsurprising. I was missing a twist that would change your view of the story and question your perception, so to speak, but that twist doesn't come. Conclusion: well done, but not top notch.",

The other phenomena seem very selfish, self-absorbed. It's ridiculous that they just sit and stare while their friends are drowning. I liked the atmosphere where they are trapped in the house and it suddenly becomes tense. The production speeds up and slows down but the pace is good. The deaths are not very effective, so they could have been a bit more disturbing. The act are in tune with each other and make an effort to be believable. Cassandra Scerbo suits this kind of production and I find her successful. There could have been a different ending. An enjoyable slasher.",

Though J. Z. Knight appears early and often as an interviewed expert in the movie, it is not until the end that she is identified as the founder of RSE, and her most controversial aspects (among which are her claim to be able to \"channel\" a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit named Ramtha) are not included at all. Many sources (for example, John Gorenfeld's September 2004 Salon article and Alison Willmore's October 2020 New York magazine article) state that this movie's three directors, William Arntz, Betsy Chasse, and Mark Vicente, were at the time also followers of Knight and RSE. Mark Vicente later became involved with another prominent cult: NXIVM, the human-potential-development and sex-trafficking pyramid scheme founded by convicted con artist Keith Raniere. After leaving NXIVM, Vicente participated in the exposé documentary series The Vow, revealing many of the cult's damaging tactics; however, nowhere in The Vow does Vicente admit that NXIVM was not his first time adhering to a cult-like group.",

I won't go through the plot, as this has been shared in another review. A hilarious outing, reminiscent of Chaplin, Tati, Keaton, Lloyd. The plot included missed connections, swapped identity, thwarted revenge, and a real twist on the \"femme fatale\" trope. I laughed out loud several times. Not a typical Hollywood movie. I'd say this film has a Belgian surrealist humor. Recommended.",

If you're looking for a fast-paced shoot 'em up, this ain't it. However, the slower parts are carried by beautiful coastline scenery as well as by the general atmosphere of the movie, which provide a calming backdrop for a rather laid back mystery about a marine botanist (Lochlann O'Mearian) researching undersea flora that may have medicinal benefits. He goes missing while on a dive, and his wife (Connie Nielsen) struggles with his absence, wondering, as we do, if there was foul play.The story, and their relationship, is revealed in pieces, sometimes using flashbacks. Her scientist husband's work was controversial, and there are indications of corporate espionage. Adding to the intrigue, she begins to get insights, perhaps of a psychic nature(?) as to what may have happened.You may have your own suspicions; one hunch I had early on turned out to be correct, but there are some genuine surprises toward the end, when it gets considerably more intense, although it never becomes what you would call a thriller. It's really more of a psychological drama, with just a hint of the supernatural or mystical.",

Anchored by Huang Bo's committed turn as a desperate father searching for his missing daughter, the film is quite successful in creating a chaotic atmosphere that swallows it whole, for better or worse (but mostly the former). In that light, it often reminded me of The World of Kanako.So, the positives first; the performances are uniformly good, the pacing just about as relentless as it gets, the chase scenes as expertly filmed as anything in modern Chinese thrillers. And the story is quite an emotional rollercoaster too; despite the film's structural deficiencies, it still manages to hit the required story beats. The most impressive sequence here marries both cathartic emotions and visceral action, coinciding a freeway chase with an incoming storm, complete with a huge tornado and fish that rain from the sky.However, parts of this film fail to completely satisfy, for example its barely coherent storytelling that is partly masked by enthusiastic filmmaking, but reveals its weaknesses upon later reflection. Some events happen almost randomly, characters disappear without further explanation and/or circumstances regarding their fates remain unclear. I've encountered these problems in other Chinese thrillers too, so it's not like I was too surprised by their appearance. Transitions between some scenes are abrupt and editing sometimes feels off; altogether more proof this film needed some more time in post-production.That being said, Across the Furious Sea is one of China's more successful genre efforts in the last few years; both commercially and creatively. Cao Baoping isn't new to crime thrillers, so this will serve just fine to further boost his profile. Genre enthusiasts would do well to check this one out, provided they keep their expectations realistic.",

I was in sort of that King zone of just really loving his writing and how he just burrows under the skin of his characters, and this really to me is very much inspired by King, it's inspired by The Twilight Zone (1959)...

As she delves deeper into the mysteries of her science, she discovers that he was also an 18th century physician at the cutting edge (depending on your perspective) of clinical practise diverting from that hardly evolved since God was a boy and leeches were ten for a pound down the apothecary. Her research uncovers the eponymous piece of literature and that's when we all start to experience the parallel timelines of this story as her 21st century, pregnant, character shows startling similarities to that of an 18th century counterpart \"Elizabeth\" - a wealthy woman in the care of \"Anmuth\". Facing modern day pressures from colleagues and latter day pressures from family and friends entirely suspicious of any kind of new thinking, she must walk a perilous tightrope. Verbeek is not a very imposing actor, and here she is supported by the equally unimpressive Sverrir Gudnason (\"Lindgren\") and though, admittedly, Dance does bring a little gravitas to the proceedings, he too struggles to get what could have been quite an intriguing story off the ground. It looks quite good, cash has clearly been spent, but not on the writing and the talent and that's disappointing.",

Val Lewton was given instructions to come up with a film that could use the still-existing set. According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. \"He would find what we call a 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, whatever it was. That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then cooked up the idea for this ship with a murderous captain.\" One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000.",

My name is Kai Jackson, and I was recently put in a difficult situation when my girlfriend tried to access my bitcoin wallet without authorization. She even tried to delete the wallet and change the PIN in a desperate attempt to lock me out. Luckily, I had predicted her moves and had changed the PIN in time to prevent her from taking the $510,000 worth of Bitcoin assets that were kept inside. I was so scared and exposed that I went to WIZARD JAMES RECOVERY, a friend's recommendation, for help. From the beginning, their group offered outstanding assistance and confidence. They listened to my narrative with sympathetic ears and promised me that they have the know-how to get my money back. The experts at WIZARD JAMES RECOVERY started a thorough investigation and painstakingly tracked down the attempt at unauthorised entry and the wallet's subsequent erasure. They were desperate to recover what was properly mine, and their technological prowess was on display as they dug deep into the intricacies of digital transactions. In just a few weeks, they recovered the complete wallet in an amazing feat of expertise and perseverance. There was an unbelievable wave of relief and gratitude that passed over me.Furthermore, WIZARD JAMES RECOVERY gave me priceless advice on bolstering my digital assets' security to stave off future intrusions. Their steadfast dedication to their work and their kind assistance were sorely needed during this difficult period. What should have been a disastrous event was turned into a story of resiliency and healing by them. I highly recommend their services to anyone facing comparable difficulties.

I understand the film makers were trying to be as honest and candid as possible, but for me, it was too much. I did not enjoy this film, skipped through all the weird disgusting parts, etc. It's not just because I felt second-hand embarrassment; like I said, I was just disgusted and confused. It took away from the plot this film COULD'VE had in my opinion. Overall I just did not enjoy this film, nor would I recommend, if I'm being completely honest.",

Picasso, Van Gogh (repeatedly), Bacon, Vermeer, and now Goya have received the treatment. I suppose our major aim in the film Nightwatching, apart from trying to match the Master's mastery of light, is to demonstrate Rembrandt as social moralist: it contains a murder mystery - the unraveling of which is the heart of the film. And also to regard Rembrandt as an inventor of cinema before the Lumière brothers...We tried to rise to the challenge in the film, remaking, with high definition digital tape, that upper right-hand corner space of Velázquez's Las Meninas - the area between the walls and ceiling has been described as the greatest bit of painting ever - a painting which is just and only and magnificently a painting of a block of darkly contrasting air. We, too, attempting a grand response Rembrandt image of light, tried to film a block of air that insubstantially floats, irrespective of walls and ceiling. Godard said that the cinema was the truth 24 frames a second. Can painting go better and say that paintings are the truth for all time? What's a second in cinema time if you can have an eternity in painting time? Cinema has come and gone in 112 years. What, then, is the age of painting?\".",

Most are predictable,this isn't 1 of those movies.It gets real interesting towards the middle and once you watch the full movie it all comes together.If you love a good plot twist(or 3) watch this film.There was only 1 other review here as I'm writing this and if that person had watched the entire movie then none of those questions would have been asked.The whole cast did great,the writing was great. I loved the bits of comedy thrown it. I'm going to find more projects by the writer.Latoya Luckett is always a joy,I hope this brings her more film projects,I like her playing this character.",

Elsas, however, demanded ransom money from the victim's family, thereby fuelling their hopes that Heijn was still alive for several weeks. The family paid the ransom, but Elsas did not respond to any of their subsequent pleas to return the victim safely. Elsas was arrested about seven months later when he was caught spending some of the ransom money; he admitted to the kidnapping and murder, and told the Police where the body was buried. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Released in 2001, he moved to a small town with his wife. On August 3, 2009, he was riding his bicycle and failed to give right of way to a digger, which ran him over, leading to his death on the same day.",

Kawasaki sponsored the event, and offered a motorcycle as a prize to the audience member who wrote the best answer to \"I believe the Zodiac kills because...\" on yellow cards that were handed out at the door. Hanson set up a team of people to analyze each entry for handwriting that matched that of the killer, and planned to confront them in the lobby if a match was found.One particular night, Hanson encountered a man who according to him closely resembled the famous wanted poster sketch and had submitted more than one entry, despite warning the staff against providing multiple ones per person. Due to the fact that the employee who was concealed in the submission box was incapacitated; Hanson had some other employees present seize the man, who reportedly didn't even act surprised when grabbed. Hanson then personally confronted him, claiming to be Zodiac victim Paul Stine's brother. The man nonchalantly responded that he was sorry to hear about Stine's murder, and ultimately, he was let go. The next day, Hanson found that the man was staying in a nearby hotel, and was apparently a Vietnam veteran. He was convinced that the man was The Zodiac and even claims to have received several letters from the killer later on, which were confiscated by the Police. Since the contest to win the motorcycle was largely a sham, no one ever \"won\" the prize, and Hanson eventually gave it away to a friend of his.",

A love scene with a wolf is just a reality. He hasn't read a script. The scene was scheduled for an evening and the wolf was fed up. He just didn't do anything anymore. He had probably eaten too much scrambled eggs. I was lying on the bed smeared with liver sausage and always had to call him, but he didn't care. The next morning we tried again, I called, he didn't come ...And suddenly he came and licked my whole head and neck and stuff and the whole scene happened exactly as in the script. And I have to say: I have never experienced such a level of dedication, such a loss of control. That inspired me so much that I could only cheer afterwards. It was the same for me in the scene where I lure the wolf with menstrual blood .... A radical surrender along with a huge loss of control. After that I was proud that I did it in front of the camera,\" she says.",

The music is horrendous auto tune vocals and the production value reminded me of a soap opera. There isn't any characters to like is one problem. Another problem is the dialogue which, at times, is ridiculous. A detailed story, told by one of the main characters, about animal abuse makes it a hard watch. There were also too many implausible scenes that would just never happen in real life. Louise Linton, as Director, I'm sure would have done a much better job as \"Chick Flick\" was a much better movie, that she Directed. It might appeal to some strictly for it's campiness but without any humor. No black comedy here. Louise Linton did a fantastic job however and did the most with the role that she was given.",

While the story was a little unbelievable at times, it was still enjoyable with a pretty good ending that brought tension to it. I hope Tubi keep doing movies like this with solid stories and good acting. One thing I did like though was even though there were a few interesting kills, the gore was kept to a minimum, the story concentrated on the mystery rather than the violence.

While making the film, the actors and Director Henry Hathaway did not know that the atomic bomb existed, nor that it would be incorporated as a story element in the movie. (None of the actors in the film mentioned the atomic bomb.) However, co-Director and Producer Louis De Rochemont (who produced the \"March of Time\" newsreel films) and Narrator Reed Hadley were involved in producing government films on the development of the atomic bomb. (Hadley was present at the final test of the bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in July, 1945.) After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Hadley and Screenwriter John Monks, Jr. hastily wrote some additional voice-over narration linking \"Process 97\" to the atomic bomb, and Rochemont inserted it into the picture in time for the film's quick release.",

On Beth Anne/Bethany's license, both the issue and exp date was June 11 - not June 17 as the exp date should've been since that was her DOB.2) The check that Bethany set up Gabby with had two different check numbers: 1937 and 1000. The one at the bottom far right is always the same number as the one at the top right corner - they are never two different numbers. Also, the bank and routing numbers on the bottom of the check were obviously fake since they both started with five or six zeros. Someone was too lazy to look at an actual check to use it as an example to go by.",

However, it falls short of its mark as its mediocre execution leaves much to be desired. The cinematography lacks finesse, with primitive shots that fail to capture the essence of the scenes. Additionally, the plot is passable at best and does not hold a lasting impression. The color palette, while aimed at reflecting the atmosphere, feels clumsily chosen and tends to irritate rather than enhance the viewing experience.From the directing to the performances, everything feels average, lacking the depth and nuance that would make it truly noteworthy. To endure this film requires an exceptional amount of patience. Yet, amidst the sea of mediocrity, there is a single scene that manages to shine. The interaction between the heroine and what she believes to be a ghost creates a captivating moment, showcasing a glimmer of potential. However, the director fails to capitalize on this cinematic technique, instead focusing on the simplistic and unrealistic portrayal of children's ghosts emerging from the ground.These bizarre events are loosely tied together, leaving viewers perplexed and searching for a stronger narrative thread.",

There are so many scenes without translated subtitles, or completely disappeared, or misplaced names or titles, this supposedly not bad Korean palatial thriller turned out to be quite clueless often. The actor who played the blind guy either played dumb or overacted like a numb and helpless guy. So if you don't know Korean language and completely rely on the only available but absolutely horrible subtitles which about 85% wrong or incorrect or clueless or either slower or faster 0.5 sec to match the on-screen dialog, all you could do is to GUESS to fool yourself. I wish there would be a more accurately translated subtitles that would allow me to watch it again from the very beginning.

Mostly used as backdrops or enhancements, they are quite noticable and the beginning of this film in particular, it was almost too much. After the opening scenes, they weren't so blatantly obvious though.The action scenes could've used a bit more finesse as they looked very choreographed.The story here is decent but it lacks depth and detail. There's enough to keep you engaged but I kept waiting for things to be explained more. I was disappointed that the rituals were not explained but they were still intriguing.My guess is that there may be sequel to this and if so, I liked this enough to want to see what else may happened.

The locals think she is a witch, and indeed when the probation officer visits her home, there are unsettling signs everywhere: her house is full of occult objects, she behaves rather strangely, and she somehow knows things, like that the officer has a son (who in the film displays symptoms consistent with cystic fibrosis) and that the father, her ex-husband, is the local police officer. Soon two local kids go missing and everyone suspects the \"witch\".The biggest problem with this movie is that it does not make the motivations of the villain clear. What was the reason for the kids' fate? What did the villain ultimately want? What were the plans for the \"mandrake baby\"? If the two victims in the first part of the movie were meant as a sacrifice, how did the villain not consider the immediate consequences?Some possibilities are hinted at, but the film does not rally explore them, so they end up being little more than suggestions for a guess. As the movie has a sort of open end, the lack of sense in the motivations of the villain becomes quite annoying. I feel like I spent nearly 1.5 hours watching a a sequence of events play out without understanding what drove it.I like my villains well-motivated, so to me this is a fairly significant drawback. On the other hand, the film does a good job of going into unpredictable directions, and it is undeniably atmospheric. Fans of horror films which put a premium on atmosphere will like this film, but those who like to understand character motivations will likely feel frustrated.",

The female lead is the only character that is somewhat entertaining. She at least tries to get us the audience involved in the mystery.

This has a few good scares in it, but they were too few and far between to make this work.The beginning of this movie hooked me. I thought, \"Finally! A good one!\" The lead actually sounded like a competent and talented newscaster and the footage felt real enough with outtakes, cover footage, and all.The first two minutes show her in front of an abandoned house doing her spiel about what happened in it and we see a figure pass by a window. It's brief and in the distance, but unmistakable and creepy. I smiled and settled in eager to see more.Then she gets stopped by a cop after she almost hits someone while driving and trying to film at the same time. He ends up asking her out for coffee and much of the rest of the movie is like watching them on terribly awkward dates. There are also several interviews with other people that aren't very entertaining and there just for exposition that we honestly don't need.She and the cop go to the abandoned house again to explore and catch some obvious footage of weird stuff that neither of them sees but we do, even though she seems to have forgotten how to use and focus a camera all of a sudden so it's all blurry and shaky - and so lame. In every handheld camera scene she seems to have absolutely no idea what she's doing anymore. It's even aimed at the floor a lot of the time. I found myself wanting to shout at the screen, \"What is wrong with you??\"And then, just as bad, for whatever reason she's obviously not reviewing her footage or she would have seen the scary blurry figure in the background just like we did - and just like we wanted to see way more of.She seems so interested and invested while looking at crime scene photos and doing interviews but dismisses anything weird that happens at while the house and doesn't review her footage? Half the time she seems intelligent and serious and the other half she's clueless and it's just a big joke to her. It doesn't work.This is a found footage movie that ignores anything it captures and over the course of an hour and a half only gives us about three and a half tiny glimpses of what we came to see. How did they possibly think that would be effective?It's a damn shame because aside from the absolutely terrible handheld camera work they had some great scenes and decent tension and even decent acting and what looked to me like a decent \"monster\". I'm okay with it never being shown clearly, just don't ignore it.I've never called a movie \"dumb\" before. This one is dumb. So dumb. I don't think it's worth your time, unfortunately. I'm giving this a very generous 4/10 for the potential it had, the talent involved, and the few effective scares.",

The way the tension builds naturally throughout the entire film pulls you deeper into Nicos story without it feeling forced or just for thrills. The cast was fantastic. Everyone did an incredible job, and the chemistry between them made the story feel even more intense. It's one of those independent films that shows just how much talent is out there. It has its quirks but the storytelling is great, it has a strong cast, and lots of suspense, Nico is a hidden gem that's worth checking out! It's a refreshing take on the genre.",

At least twice in the film, they forgot to add in the sound effects. The last one I noticed was when he gets shot, they forgot to put in the gunfire sound, also one scene earlier where they forgot to put in the sound of the slap that would have provoked that kind of reaction, instead there is just silence. Then the sound quality dies at the end of the film, not to mention the fact that she is clearly talking on the phone that is not connected to a phone call. I could go on but I won't.The acting is for the most part awful. Some scenes are bearable, most are awful, some are just down right cringey.The story has many holes in it and an irrelevant character that is not necessary for the story and in fact is very cringe-worthy and takes away from the film rather than adding to it. With a slightly better script it could have been good. The first half though is not as bad as the second half. It seems every one got tired of doing the film and/or they run out of money.I can tolerate a lot and forgive some mistakes, but this really takes the biscuit, so much so, I had to join up here to write this, which I don't usually bother with.A cult classic - NOT EVER.

I hope the cadavers in this movie weren't actresses lying still. If they were, then you have my heartfelt respect. To be covered in so many crawling maggots as they twitched and skimmed the hairs on your body: Urgh!What Corpse Mania possesses in its story is an evolving and unfolding murder mystery. I would hasten to add that it's one of the best I've seen. It works brilliantly to keep your curiosity circulating through your brain as you try to deduce, before the detective, who is the demented killer. What's more, the clues are there - along with a plethora of red herrings. Sadly, the story stales around midway, and my attention drifted - Though only slightly. I was back to being fully immersed for the climactic reveal, which I'd only gotten half correct. Damn, my deductive skills are slipping.This dark thriller does contain some wince-inducing imagery. Enter slick bluish-skinned naked women covered in maggots. Alone, that is awful enough, but they then add the necrophilia element into the mix. If these scenes don't chill the morrow in your bones, I think you should go and see somebody. However, it's Chih-Hung Kuei that makes these frightful scenes more frightening by adding soft focus, subdued lighting, and empathic colours, which gives them a sense of elegance and grandeur, especially in the corpse washing section. And that only adds to your uneasiness. Kuei lets the story unfold at a steady pace, which is ideal for this type of tale. It allows the audience plenty of time to take in the facts and the gory details.The cast, on the whole, is excellently suited to their characters. The one exception is Master Li, though I suspect that is down more to the writing than the actor's performance. It would have been nice to have more background on Master Li and his motives for wanting to free the prostitutes. It would have given the actor more to put into his performance. At the moment, he's cold and mysterious, which isn't a terrible thing. But the poor old actor just sits around looking bored. He needed more fire in those eyes. When you see Master Li, you see a bloke who's laidback to the point of being horizontal. He doesn't appear to possess the energy or the motive to carry out these acts. I wanted more from our alleged madman fetishist.I would happily recommend Corpse Mania to all dark thriller fans around the globe. And, I hope your little grey cells fire better than mine did on the day.Please feel free to visit my Killer Thriller Chiller and The Game Is Afoot lists to see where I ranked Corpse Mania.Take Care & Stay Well.",

The mystery (or the lack of) is so terribly sketched that I felt it had nothing to achieve, even though the protagonist keeps making such a big, nonsensical fuss. The makers also add a couple of pointless jumpscares. In the end, it just feels like you wholly wasted 90-odd minutes.",

            "storyline": "This Land of Mine boldly ventures into uncharted territory for Malaysian cinema, presenting an ambitious mix of mockumentary and found footage genres-a rare sight in the local film landscape. Helmed by a passionate indie team, the film brings a compelling premise to the table: a deep dive into humanity's darker instincts, all set against the mysterious and ominous backdrop of the Malaysian wilderness.Visually, the film struggles with its limited budget. The CGI, used heavily for the central creature, feels cartoonish and out of place, often detracting from the intended suspense. While the effort to bring such a project to life with minimal resources is commendable, the execution leaves much to be desired. The creature design itself feels underwhelming, lacking the originality or shock value needed to captivate audiences. Without context-such as a prologue referencing the supposed \"real-life evidence\" that inspired the creature-the reveal falls flat, failing to deliver the impact it seems to aim for.The film's storytelling is its Achilles' heel. While the concept is intriguing, the plot fails to sustain interest over its runtime. The mockumentary format, coupled with the found footage aesthetic, initially promises an engaging narrative, but the subplots and revelations never rise above the ordinary. The movie stumbles in answering a crucial question: how do you stretch a great idea into a full-length feature? The result is a series of moments that, while not outright dull, lack the tension or novelty to hold the viewer's attention.Despite these shortcomings, This Land of Mine does offer thematic depth. The narrative explores issues such as greed, ethics in medicine, and the fragile balance between human ambition and morality. These elements give the film a thoughtful edge, elevating it beyond a mere popcorn flick. The inclusion of such themes shows the filmmakers' desire to spark meaningful conversations, which is a refreshing change in the landscape of local cinema.The performances are serviceable, considering the challenges faced by the cast. Many are newcomers, and their inexperience shows in some of the dialogue delivery and emotional beats. Filming on-location in the dense Malaysian forest while imagining a CGI creature must have been no easy task. Still, there are moments of raw intensity that suit the gritty found footage style, even if the overall character dynamics lack chemistry.One notable drawback is the film's color grading and lighting choices. Many scenes are overly dark, making it difficult to discern key moments on screen. Whether intentional or a technical limitation, this decision ultimately detracts from the viewing experience, leaving audiences frustrated rather than immersed.Verdict: This Land of Mine is a brave attempt at innovation within Malaysian cinema, bringing a unique genre and thought-provoking themes to the forefront. While the concept is promising and the moral undertones resonate, the execution falters in key areas like pacing, visual design, and narrative depth. It's an admirable effort that showcases potential, but falls short of becoming a must-watch. For fans of indie filmmaking and experimental storytelling, it's worth checking out as a step forward in local cinema, even if it's not without its flaws.",

There are some horror movie clichés and definitely plot holes, but overall it's a pretty decent and entertaining film, just don't go in expecting award winning, complex writing & characters. I found the acting, atmosphere and cinematography to be quite decent. There are intense and scary moments, and the make-up is pretty good, especially on the Tiger, who's popping out from every single angle. The girl is also pretty freaky when you think about it. As others have noted, her innocence is what makes it her scary. I recommend it if you have some spare time and like Asian horror movies.",

I have already talked about it with the production and the premise is that the final decision is yours. I've been thinking a lot about the scene where you cut yourself (I was originally supposed to be sitting on the edge of the bathtub, dressed, and he would start from the trickle of blood and go back up to me), and I'm asking you to do it nude. It's a nude that makes sense though, for the scene, for the character and her private moment. For me it would be much stronger, however, I defer to you, because it was not in the script.' I answer him, 'Roberto, for me nudity -if it makes sense- doesn't involve any problem. My body is my instrument, I am an actress.' Then we start talking about the scene, which was originally supposed to have me sitting, or semi-sitting, while cutting myself. Then I reflect on it and say, 'I have a proposal: what if I were in the fetal position? For a character like Elena, the most private moment, of returning to the essence, must correspond to a return to the uterine environment, to a condition of absolute protection from the outside world. In my opinion, for Elena there is no greater intimacy. And you should frame her from above, naked, inside that tub' The result was stylistically and visually perfect. It is a nude, but one of extraordinary elegance. And I was blown away when I saw the camera movement he did, 180 degrees. After he finished, he made a point of showing me the shot.\"",

Good acting by Udhayanidhi and the eyes searching for something that he needed from start to the end were held in esteem. Excellent cinematography which shooting on anamorphic gave it more depth with supporting good color grade by the colorist. The music tried to elevate during the high tension scenes but it was dull. The Interval portion and the climax elevated the movie to a level in which other parts failed. Some characters have not created any impact and have been vulnerable which has to be properly versed for the story. Whipping the upper castes and their discrimination against the lower castes was the best part. Bit slow narration so felt more lag initially, predictable yet the story made its justice. The person should rely on the law for justice but seeing our country's conditions, it's highly questionable. A proper impactful Movie.",

            "storyline": "It's not often we're blessed with renowned Los Angeles musician John Doe in the lead of a feature film: a resume where the 1992 biker-road flick \"Roadside Prophets\" (1992) serves as one of the rarities, while the 2007 rom-com \"Ten Inch Hero\" (2007) offers one of his best.Upon first awareness of John Doe fronting this noir thriller helmed by ex-radio DJ-turned-filmmaker Kurt St. Thomas (the duo filmed 2001's \"The Red Right Hand\"), fans clamored for this loosely-based, retro-remake of the Rudolph Maté classic (cinephiles recall Maté was the cinematographer on Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1932 masterpiece, \"Vampyr,\" as well as the director of the 1951 sci-fi disaster classic, \"When World's Collide\").How did this St. Augustine, Florida-produced film come to fruition?As with the four previous remakes of the 1950 original -- the Australian-made \"Color Me Dead\" (1969), the \"official\" Dennis Quaid remake (1988), a modernized inversion starring Jason Statham, \"Crank\" (1988), and the poorly-received \"Dead on Arrival\" (2017; starring the likable DB Sweeney as the modernized gumshoe) -- a copyright clerical error at Cardinal Pictures, the production company behind the noir original, lapsed the story into the public domain.Of the above noted remakes -- and while most of the plot elements of this $50,000-budgeted production are original to the film -- this is the most faithful adaptation, courtesy of St. Thomas producing it as a black and period piece set in 1949. His choosing to set the noirish narrative in the quaint, seaside town of St. Augustine, Florida -- with its photogenic mix of 19th century and '50s-styled architecture, including a spotlight of the town's 1870-built lighthouse -- lends to the film's authenticity; a realism buoyed by production designer Bonnie Druckenmiller acquiring period-correct vintage cars, as well as dressing makeshift warehouse, set-built hospital rooms with a major studio-level quality on a shoestring budget.Another highlight is the black and white camera work by 2nd unit/camera department warhorse Peter Berglund (2009's \"Iron Man,\" 2012's \"Dredd,\" and 2015's \"Straight Outta Compton\"). On a production that couldn't afford a steady cam or chapman dolly -- to pull off a stunning dolly shot with a $50.00-used wheelchair acquired from a local Goodwill -- well, the next time Berglund's name appears on a film's credits: I'm streaming that film.For those not familiar with the noir genre, they can rely on this Nicholas Griffin-penned screenplay (2003's \"Matchstick Men\" starring Nicolas Cage; 2010's \"Knight and Day\" starring Tom Cruise) as a well-written introduction -- and a refresher course to noir fans -- that'll inspire a (re)watch of the original. It will also inspire one's exploration of the unfamiliar acting resume of John Doe: perhaps you recall his sniveling turn as Pat McGurn in 1989's \"Road House,\" as one of his many support roles in over sixty films.As was Edward O'Brien in the original: John Doe is Detective Frank Bigelow. In voiced-over flashback: he confesses a story of being hired by a femme fatale socialite that leads to his deadly poising -- and his against-the-clock investigation to find the killer. Clues discovered during the investigation are offered by the familiar, always-welcomed TV/film actors Lucinda Jenney (2019's \"Three from Hell\") and John Byner (1983's \"Stoker Ace\" with Burt Reynolds, 1997's \"Wishmaster\"). Yes, that's former \"120 Minutes\" MTV VJ Matt Pinfeld antagonizing John Doe -- and he equally shines in his support role.If you enjoyed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998) -- itself based on the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler, books which fueled several film noirs of the '40s and '50s -- you'll enjoy this updated homage to the era. As with that Coen-made, noir-inversion: the reviews on Kurt St. Thomas's take will probably be streamer-mixed-to-the-negative due to its against-the-budget, independent production values that those weaned on major studio films may not appreciate; however, reviews on the Coen's (major studio) effort eventually shifted to the cult status-positive.This professionally-produced film noir redux on a budget quickly became a multiple film festival award winner that quietly made its debut on steaming platforms in October 2023. It's a highly-suggested watch, for it is independent filmmaking at its finest.",

Others believe that he was from Vallejo. The fact that \"No Way To Treat a Lady\" was about a serial killer who enjoys taunting the policeman on his trail makes it an interesting footnote to the Zodiac Killer case.",

            "storyline": "Why do I rate The Cat so highly? In no way is this the scariest film I have ever watched, nor is it the greatest. But the acting, coupled with the feature's ability to blend great emotional depth, alongside developed characterization, a mesmerizing plot and a spooky atmosphere, make this a film that certainly ought to be experienced.Slightly similar to the Grudge and Dark Water, the title of the film should have been pluralized, because there sure are a lot of puddy cats that occupy the feature. So-yeon (Min-Young Park) works at Kitty N Puppy, a pet store that not only sells animals, but is dedicated to the grooming and cleaning of our four legged friends.Suffering the affects of claustrophobia after experiencing a childhood trauma, So-yeon goes out of her way to ensure her life is free of the obstacles that heighten her condition. The fear she often feels is well articulated on screen, and is further accentuated through the terror that begins to haunt her so.After Silky, a cat So-yeon recently pampered inexplicably dies, the cat finds herself temporarily without a home. Her friend, Jun-seok (Dong-wook Kim), a police officer investigating the peculiar death, asks her to take Silky in for the time being. Immediately after So-yeon agrees, she finds herself plagued by nightmares, and whilst awake sees images of a little girl.Unlike stereotypical Asian horror, the ghost of the young girl is not equipped with a head of hair in need of immediate trimming. Rather, what separates her from other ghosts are her unique cat eyes, and even when she is hiding in the darkness, those eyes of hers, so bright and haunting, are clearly visible, and add to the feeling of being watched. This is further implied by the camera, which is occasionally from the perspective of the girl herself. The way the ghost is portrayed, and how she can unexpectedly jump out at the audience is excellently developed, providing a good number of jump scares.When So-yeon's friend Bo-hee (Da-eun Sin), alongside other people who encounter cats they bring into their lives, begin to witness the ghost as well, it becomes clear that she is no illusion. When people's lives begin to be put in jeopardy, So-yeon discovers she is going to have to combat her own fears if it means uncovering the truth behind the ghost, and the connection with the cats.Unlike other horror films, where deaths are often the same, though there is more than one occasion when a body is contorted in terrifying fear, other times the deaths are quite surprising, with some combined originality. Though it becomes predictable to know when a character will die, it is how, that will always keep your interest.Though the Cat is not the most terrifying feature ever encountered, despite the effective ambiance, what audiences will occasionally find most shocking is the treatment cats receive when in the care of animal shelters and other such accommodations. The lacking dignity and humility provided to the cats really hits home about the cruelty that takes place behind closed doors, and one scene, when a cat is put to sleep, the look of terror upon the poor animal's face is wretchedly heartbreaking. In this sense, The Cat is a film that requires viewing, if not for the story or character relationships, then for the brutal honesty of the environments cats are often forced to endure.The Cat is bound to keep you on edge from the opening credits, through to the final scene, the tension and mystery surrounding the plot been pivotal to the success of the movie. The emotional depth is as equally satisfactory, and by the film's conclusion, you will want to curl up next to your kitten and give them a great big hug.",

            "storyline": "Joe Hollow's \"Flesh of the Unforgiven\" is a bold, gonzo horror delicacy that thrives on its bizarre, unconventional structure. While certain moments feel familiar, Hollow doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel; instead, he makes it uniquely his own, and it works beautifully. At times, it feels as though you're watching the work of a cinematic child born from David Lynch and Tim Burton-August Kyss embodies this perfectly.Debbie Rochon and Joe Hollow deliver strong performances as a husband and wife at a crossroads in their dysfunctional marriage. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable and, in the world of independent horror, refreshingly rare. With a cinematography and sound that are nicely polished, the plot twists and turns keep you engaged until the very end.The special effects may appear a bit dated at times, but there's a charm to them that feels like a nostalgic nod to the golden era of horror-a time that many fans still long for.Overall \"Flesh of the Unforgiven\" is a fun, memorable ride that might just invite a second viewing.",

This film is pretentious in its aim to appear arty and fails dismally in its eager to engage the audience (at least this viewer) with a thin lesbian story line of attraction and jealousy. The main characters remain cardboard figures, no real emotions at stake at any point. Very few directors have managed to create an erotic and sensual atmosphere between two women. I can think of only four: Patricia Rozema (When Night is Falling), Andy/Larry Wachowski (Bound), David Lynch (Mulholland Drive) and Lukas Moodyson (Show Me Love). But of course, it's a matter of taste - or perhaps I've been missing something?",

Most of Katja's time is spent fiddling with all sorts of hi-tech gadgets (smart phones, microphones, tablets, displays.....) and answering calls from various individuals all speaking in riddles and issuing not-so-thinly veiled threats. Her skills with plugs, cables, androids etc. Are truly amazing. Although she keeps reminding her interlocutors that she is fully retired from her chosen profession (espionage?), they all sound skeptical and they keep harassing her.Now and again some other characters turn up, in what one might call cameo appearances, but since most of the scenes are in pitch darkness, their role is never clearly defined. An occasionally mentioned connection to the 2008 American presidential election has left me floored.All in all, a complete waste of about 90 minutes of valuable time. The movie however does have one redeeming feature: the Swiss mountainscape is truly stunning.",

There's also nudity involved, though with all craziness going on, I'm not sure that's something to be upset about or looking forward to.

The use of blue and red colors in the film create a sense of blood and the ocean, communicating many deep messages that soothe the mind while making your blood rise. Not to mention, the way the interplay of powers was done quite well and each character was developed to have an identity and backstory that made me care.Rebecca Ugo definitely did a number with the suspense on this.

On the original recording, at about 3 minutes and 25 seconds, a voice can be heard speaking rapidly for about two seconds. The two main characters in the film have no idea what the voice is saying and it intrigues them. However, according to a biography of the violinist-composer Efrem Zimbalist Sr. (father of the famous film and television actor), Sarasate was actually \"instructing his accompanist to cut the slow section\" of the composition, presumably to accommodate the limited recording time of the disk.",

Speaking of this movie, I'm sorry I can't spoil how exciting the whole film is, but there's one scene I must share deeply. The female lead is trapped in a car with a bomb, and the support team outside is discussing which wire to cut. It's a choice between blind instinct for self-preservation and trusting the judgment of a professional. Which one would I choose? Am I mentally prepared to accept the outcome? How about you?

I was torn between feeling contempt for the father figure for the deception that tears apart his young daughter, and the compassion for the grandparent (sheriff) desperately trying to solve the cold case of the tragic vanishing of his young grand daughter. Twists and turns drive the story along the emotional peaks and valleys that are acted beautifully. Bravo!",

There is a concept known as \"verimilisitude\", which is the idea that it doesn't matter if your concept is set in hyper reality, in outer space, or in a child's animation, if you don't buy into a personality or situation in order to suspend your disbelief, the entire effort is an abject failure. From filmmakers, to stand up comics and other storytellers, this is an essential facet of a creative arsenal.There is just no reason any filmmaker should have such bad plotting, characterization and dialogue as this. I can forgive bad or amateurish acting, but maybe the issue is they have nothing to work from.",

It's a movie about a buried past, but not the exact past that you would expect in a usual thriller about murder. This one is massive, concerning on a global scale and serves a good reminder that monsters live among us.The ending makes the movie great. Don't want to spoil it, so won't be going into details, but I loved how it was realistic and thoughtful. You know, lies constantly require more lies to keep them floating, and people will never stop getting hurt until these lies stop.Thanks for a good movie!",

The film stumbles through a maze of plot holes, leaving viewers scratching their heads at the bewildering behaviors of characters. Unfortunately, the antagonist's motives are shrouded in mystery, with no clear explanation for his puzzling actions. The perplexity deepens as the audience grapples with questions like why he kidnaps people to form his 'family' and the murky origins of his so-called son.The storyline suffers from a lack of coherent reasoning, rendering the antagonist's actions nonsensical and perplexing. As the movie unfolds, you're left grappling with a sense of aimlessness, struggling to find any purpose behind the illogical steps characters take. The result is a cinematic experience that lacks the crucial foundation of a comprehensible narrative.Even the behavior of the daughter, presumably a central character, adds to the confusion. Her seemingly irrational choices in dire situations defy common sense, contributing to the overall sense of frustration. Instead of prioritizing her own safety, her efforts to 'save' her brainwashed brother come across as bizarre and frustratingly illogical.\"Daughter\" is further hampered by a sluggish pace that fails to engage the audience effectively. The lack of clear reasoning behind characters' actions makes it difficult to invest emotionally in their journeys. As a result, what could have been a compelling narrative is reduced to a convoluted and bewildering mess.",

It's supposed to be about a former reporter filled with remorse about not helping the police capture a serial killer years before who is suddenly being targeted herself. Why, then, did we need to know about her former marriage - replete with flashbacks? Why, then, did there have to be a past romance between her and the cop on the case? Why, then, did there need to be this irritating professor at the college she's hired to teach ethics in journalism at who adds nothing to the story and offers perhaps the worst performance of a bunch of bad performances? Why, then, did she even need to have a son? And - my pet peeve - why did this Canadian movie have to pretend to be an American movie by placing itself in Cambridge, Massachussetts? (I mean, Kate could just as easily have left Toronto to teach in Peterborough.) On behalf of all Canadians, I apologize to the people of Cambridge for setting such a dreadful movie in your city. Those who put out this movie should now apologize to us all. 1/10",

My wife's theory on the second baby was that she had had wins, and left one behind when leaving . My theory, given her obsessive behavior, is that she obtained a second infant (maybe adoption) and swapped him to Lorenco for Henrik. Whichever happened, the Lawyer is legally bound to report her findings and bring Sigrid before authorities. DNA's will finally tell the real story.\nCONTRIVED, but INTERESTING.

Directed with a delicate touch, the film unravels the story of an enigmatic protagonist ADI haunted by past choices and ancestral ties.The symbolism of the Khamsa, a hand shaped amulet, is cleverly woven into the narrative, representing both protection and fate. As the character delves into the mysterious well, the film explores themes of identity, loss, and the search for redemption. Visually, the film is striking, with the arid desert landscapes reflecting the inner emptiness of the characters. The haunting score complements the slow burning tension that keeps viewers on edge.Khamsa leaves its audience pondering long after the credits roll, with its thought provoking exploration of oblivion and self-discovery. The well becomes more than just a physical place it represents the abyss we must face when we confront our deepest fears. Bold and poetic, this movie is a compelling dive into the unknown.",

            "storyline": "Joshiy is perhaps the greatest mass movie maker Malayalam has ever seen with the possible exception of Shaji Kailas. From \"New Delhi (1987)\" to \"Lion (2006)\", the master director has given us an array of character-driven mass heroes, in direct contrast to the template physicality we have seen in the genre, relying more on power of personality and dialogue to deliver mass elevation sequences. In \"Paappan\", he gives us a more understated, brooding and low key avatar of superstar Suresh Gopi which while being appreciable, still just barely manages to salvage an overlong, trite film.The story follows the journey of retired Circle Inspector \"Abraham Paappan\" (Suresh Gopi) and his estranged daughter, ASP Vincy Abraham (an excellent Neeta Pillai) as they are forced to put aside their differences and work together to track down an elusive serial killer. The writing from RJ Shaan is unimaginative and cliche-ridden, relying on familiar tropes we have seen umpteen times in films such as \"Ee Thanutha Veluppan Kalathu (1990)\", \"Memories (2013)\" and \"Anjaam Pathiraa (2020)\", offering nothing ingenuitive or unexpected to justify its overlong, overstuffed 2 hour 50 minute run-time.The supporting performances from Asha Sharath, Nandhu, Gokul Suresh, Kaniha and co remain surface-level and without impact not due to their performances but due to clear lack of tightness in the script and depth in the writing. There are so many characters moving in and out of the narrative without ever justifying their presence that after a point the audience will want to give up. The director might have thought these barrage of red herrings would have built up the suspense element, but they act contradictory to expectations, giving a contrived and exhausting sheen to proceedings.It was refreshing to see Suresh Gopi in an aged, battle-weary avatar as a dejected cop trying to rewrite old wrongs and Neeta Pillai holds her own as a fierce, steadfast cop who habitually puts duty above family and relationships. Unfortunately, the script and narrative fall apart around them the more you get into the movie, with the vapid, cringeworthy climax, especially leaving a bad taste in the mouth. Watch this one at your own risk. In a year that gave Malayalam thrillers of the level of \"Twenty One Grams\" and \"Ela Veezha Poonchira\", \"Paappan\" does not pass the acid test and ends up being sub-par. If you are expecting classic Joshiy level thrills and chills, you will be sorely disappointed!",

Lewis was famous for setting up the camera in bizarre places and fashions (avoiding actors' faces quite often) and intentionally held scenes for awkward amounts of time to build tension. When the Columbia producer visited the set, he thought Lewis was crazy. They fought over schedules and budgets, as well as Lewis's artistic license to set up his scenes as he liked, and Lewis threw the Columbia producer off the set. Lewis was well on his way to becoming a pariah at Columbia until co-founder and president Harry Cohn screened the film. He supposedly shouted at his producer, \"Send him a barrel of whiskey, because any man with this talent can take the time he wants to. Now don't bother him.\"",

Likewise the fortunate viewer will doubtless be elevated by the sheer joie de vivre indelibly etched into every fiber of this stunning motion picture. Alas, some may be dismayed by the gratuitous nudity, lesbian incest, or even the insinuation of jungle-girl/gorilla-suit-wearing-boy romance. This, however, can be readily rectified by prompt removal of any superfluous objects(heads, thumbs, etc.) from crucial bodily passageways.

It's just a simple,plain story in which they wanted to present that all miseries and misfortunes that happen returns as boomerang. Good becomes bad, bad becomes good, criminal becomes honest, idiot becomes clever, witty person. It is just too much considering that characters aren't actually real. And the situations they put themselves are overbuilt and pretentious. The pace and mise-en-scene are dreadful. Actors were losing themselves practically laughing at themselves for doing mediocre work. The only good thing in the whole film is character and performance Milena Dravic did. She is absolutely breathtaking, I was at the edge of my seat on the scene at the movies. She was absolutely wonderful, an Oscar winning performance for supporting actress.But all in all this film is completely not worth seeing cause a lot of people would be  annoyed and by the direction and by the pace.

How would you feel? How would be your perfomance?Overall, this film worths to have a chance. I know Argentinean films have no much admiration, but I swear this film is a special one wich makes you think if it is possible to be into a rol as much as in a real mental health hospital.",

Instead of doing this with the male, she freed the female, who then attacked the male, who then shot the female, which required the Sheriff to shoot the male.

This is in many respects nothing like the movie Taxi Driver - it does however have a key moment of the movie fully blown into a theme ... kind of like, how not to talk or behave around women. Martina Gedeck can play weird characters and she is amazing in this. So no pun intended as always.But telling a woman your \"hobby\" (for lack of a better word or expression), even more so if the main male character (\"love interest\") is supposed to be into psychology ... well maybe it does make sense. But not the way you may think it does.While nothing is shown explicitly - well apart from nudity that is of course, you should not be too sensitive when it comes to the theme of sexuality ... also some violence ... it is not an easy movie to watch ... it tries to break barriers and it is not a how to guide ... it is two broken individuals .... both looking for love ... unable to form or express that in the confinements of how society sees it and approves of it ... you have to dig weirdness to say the least and go into quite the dark places ... mentally and otherwise ... this is not healthy (or happy in any sense of what we would attribute to it)!

There are really few words to describe this film nightmare, I find it shameful and especially disrespectful towards the real victims, I appreciated the concept of sending an important message to society, but this is the wrong way. I would have really preferred to watch a news report rather than lose almost two hours of my life to see this scempio that wants to send a very important message but the latter is overwhelmed by a thousand and more mistakes.",

The FL gets stuck on the ship as it pulls away from the port. The characters in the film, namely the murder suspects, are all theatrical in nature and their costuming. Easy to watch and the murder is solved with an easy going cute ending to a love story as the ML and FL try to solve the murder together since they witnessed it but no one, including the Captain of the ship believes them.",

I've seen almost everything he's been in and I think he should be in more movies, have better parts etc. And OMG, that voice of his when he sings is simply amazing.

While, IMO, the 10 Star reviews are being overly generous, I do not think that the film is being fairly judged by the 2.4 Star overall rating.The film has an interesting concept and the main themes deal with spirits, possession, cursed marks, sigils and shamanism that are derived from Nigerian beliefs. You're given a limited, basic understanding of these beliefs and they are just enough to sorta guide you through the film.The actors weren't overly impressive but they weren't bad either. After the first five minutes or so, the film has a rough, slow start to it but picks up towards the end and becomes a bit more interesting and engaging. Some of the special effects were decent and others were mediocre CGI.I'm not gonna say it was awful because it held my interest but I cannot deny that I wanted it to give more than it did. It is lacking something special but I can't pinpoint what it needs.I would say that if you're a fan of films about spirits and possession, you might find something different and interesting by watching this. However, if you are looking for something that guarantees you will have chills and thrills you might be a bit disappointed. If you plan on watching it, watch it for the concept not the horror aspect.",

            "storyline": "Who but Lifetime? Some of their original TV movies are gladly sincere, others split the difference between earnest storytelling and deliberate kitsch (whether of the romantic or thriller varieties), and still others are so unabashedly over the top that they become gleeful B-movie delights. As if the name alone weren't indication enough, I'm very happy to report that 'It's beginning to look a lot like murder' falls quite decisively into the third category. It's not as completely wild and fun as the likes of 'Pom poms and payback,' or 'Secret lives of college escorts'; in fact, it rather takes the approach of being farcical precisely because it pretends so hard at being straitlaced and straightforward. Yet anyone who has spent any time watching like-minded fare in other genres (chiefly horror and sci-fi) will readily recognize the tack that is adopted in these eighty-five minutes, and provided you can get on board with such fare, this is a minor delight!The narrative is pointedly, irreverently direct, with all elements perfectly aligning Just So and accentuating the artificiality. Of course protagonist Diana (and best friend Riley, with whom she regularly speaks) would be an avid listener of true crime podcasts, and of course she would be established right away as an enthusiast of murder mystery novels. Why wouldn't she be? Of course Diana and Riley are suspicious of everyone and everything, and believe they have great insight on a real-life mystery; of course every possible moment is filled with falsely tense, suspenseful music cues, sudden and unexpected sound effects, and/or patently contrived, inflated dramatic beats (e.g., suddenly turning around and coming face to face with - gasp! - oh, no one of importance). The direction of Amy Barrett (well, isn't that an unfortunate name to have these days), the scene writing, dialogue, and characterizations in Dana Lin's screenplay, and the acting of all involved are bent toward purposefully hokey, plastic phoniness. Of course Cristine Prosperi would seem to stand out most as she depicts our protagonist, but Angelie Simone seems hellbent on upstaging Prosperi in that regard in her extra-exaggerated depiction of Riley - but that's certainly not to count out other co-stars including Erin Gray, Travis Burns, and more. 'It's beginning to look a lot like murder' is conscious bunkum, and in every way it very much wants us to know it.That's not to say that it isn't well made. There are some unexpectedly nice shots scattered throughout, and Thomas L. Callaway's cinematography is smart and admirable. The hair and makeup work is lovely, and the costume design, and art director Maxwell Mahan really just let his imagination run wild. Though the cast bends their skills to distinctly dishonest ends, their performances are solid and beyond reproach just as they are. Why, this little flick joyfully smashes together both the murder mystery and the holiday romance, and even for as plainly bogus as the amalgamation is - not least as some scenes switch moods on a dime - none of this is accidental, or ill-considered. To that same point, though the holiday hues are primarily just seasonal seasoning, they are not exclusively so, and there are some genuine, somewhat clever ideas in the root plot. At the same time the film is firmly aware of what flagrant balderdash it is in total, and there are absolutely plenty of moments so outrageous as to inspire laughter. And I guess that leads us to the chief definitive fault of 'It's beginning to look a lot like murder,' which is tonal inconsistency. The feature is undeniable baloney, and it never pretends otherwise. Even so it swings a little too much, with too much disparity, between riotous absurdity, warm romance, and darker mystery or thrillers vibes, with the latter two facets being played with notably more seriousness. If Barrett or Lin had chosen just one track instead of hopping between both somber and overwrought, and embraced that one track more fully, then the end result would surely have been more enjoyable overall.All told I actually do like this, and it's capably entertaining all on its own very forthright accord. It's just that with a little more judicious care applied one way or the other, I'm very sure it could have been either a terrific romp like 'My killer client' or 'Wheels of beauty,' or a more thoughtful, sober drama or thriller like 2006's 'Fatal trust,' with Amy Jo Johnson, or 2021's 'Lethal love letter' with Clare Grant. In any event, I think those who are receptive to all that the medium has to offer, and Lifetime - good, bad, weird, real, flippant - will have a good time watching this; if not, well, there's not anything here to change your mind. Don't go out of your way for this title, but if you do have the chance to watch and are ready to engage with it on its level, then 'It's beginning to look a lot like murder' is worth checking out.",

The synopsis doesn't really capture the idea. Danda is not a very large part of the movie, as you'll notice by the fact that he isn't in the top cast.The movie revolves largely around the mask maker, the groups who oppose each other, who Hiroku truly is, and the phenomenon itself. The wearing of masks extends into other schools and eventually becomes somewhat of a fad. Many people choose to be \"reborn\" into a new person by shedding their personality and using the mask to reveal their new one. This leads to unhinged behavior, including violence in some cases.It definitely has the message of who a person becomes when they become anonymous. Much like how anonymity on the internet tends to allow for more freedom of speaking one's mind. There is a lot going on, but I don't feel like it is hard to take it all in. Certainly some elements could've used more screen time, but dragging the movie out probably would've been difficult. For an hour and a half watch, it is pretty good and keeps you fairly interested in figuring out what exactly is going on in terms of who is who, and what not. In some ways, it is predictable, but in other ways it can be a bit elusive and has a different ending than expected.As for the cast, you'll certainly notice some fairly popular people on the Top Cast section. They've also worked together in other movies, so seem to do well on screen together.",

After a couple of hours in, the viewer knows where the climax is headed to and I felt myself saying to the tv, let's get on with it. Every single actor did superb work in their roles...it was far superior than most made for tv productions. The only other flaw would be something for trial attorneys. The defense attorney does a great job shooting holes in the key eyewitness testimony, but does not even cross-examine the final 'clothing' witness for offering what is only circumstantial evidence. Then, in summation, the defense does not even mention the prosecution's wholly circumstantial case (clearly reasonable doubts were on the table) but rather gives only a brief appeal to character. The final, final scene, although delivering great shock appeal, would likely be unnecessary to the outcome if the defense attorney was scripted to be more adept at courtroom defense.",

Very entertaining. I highly recommend \"Twisted Vines.\" Vivica Fox captured her character beautifully, and she was surrounded with a talented team of actors. The winery itself became another character in the film. The fire trapping them together added to the thrills, as did the nighttime filming. Everyone was truly believable and the twists and turns in the plot had me fooled until the end. I had read professional movie reviews before I saw it -- their high ratings were justly deserved. Great job all!",

This movie is not only an excellent suspense film, but also satirizes society in its core. The first half of the male protagonist's life is a microcosm of how many Chinese style families! Although the movie has many storylines, each of which is not clearly explained, the flaws do not overshadow the strengths. The plot is very innovative and complex, with ups and downs and multiple twists and turns. Only in the end can the truth be revealed! The character portrayal in the movie is average, except for the protagonist who feels quite flat. The narrative method is very interesting, using the technique of interludes. The best part of the film is the photography, which is really great! The texture is very unique! Although the ending is still a perfect one, fortunately there is no deliberate plot like this in the movie. It is a movie worth watching.",

Vladimir Sorokin, who wrote the script, is very scandalous author who loves to shock audience. Besides, he is obviously postmodernist, so his stories are always full of different layers of meaning, contain a lot of symbols. Often you can't understand for sure whether he is kidding or being serious. The last but not the least, the movie is brilliant at camera work and has an amazing soundtrack.",

It just seemed to drag out with a lot of wandering around buildings and trying to make connections between paperwork, places, and people.

It might have made a half decent short film, but this is a long, boring sleep-enhancer. Watch The Others to see how a tense single mother period drama can be done effectively.There are good ways to have a character wander around the same corridor over and over again to build tension.

However, there are hints quite early on that the narrative is not as straightforward as it seems to be - the dead body of Tim's aunt is discovered by Juliet, who appears to be a complete stranger to Tim, and yet, when he gets back to England, she has suddenly become his fiancee, although there have been no scenes between them of a romantic nature at all, and his time does seem to have been fully occupied with his investigations. This mysterious plot-lacuna is never even referred to, much less explained.",

But getting Ashok Kumar, the\nonly one who Goldie was convinced could carry off the role of the suave villain,\nwas difficult. Dadamoni had just returned from a heart surgery and when Goldie\ntrekked to Roop Tara studio with the intention of getting his okay, he\nknew he had a task on his hands. Dev Anand introduced him to Dadamoni saying,\n\"Goldie wants to make a film with you.\" After that the younger Anand took over,\ntelling Dadamoni that he was making a two hero project. \"I want you to play the\ntitle role. It's a very challenging role. The only problem is that we learn in\nthe last reel that your character is the film's bad man. But you've played the\nanti-hero before. You can do it. In fact, only you can do it. You're a\ncourageous actor, yes, you are,\" Goldie coaxed the veteran actor. Ashok Kumar\nwas game. But he laid down three conditions. \"I'm not going to hit anyone. And\nno one should hit me. If I get into fisticuffs it'll kill me,\" he warned Goldie.\nGoldie assured him that there would be no fights. His villain was an\nintellectual villain. He uses his mind, not his muscles. Dadamoni was relieved\nto hear that. His final condition was that he would report on the sets at 11\na.m. sharp with make-up on. Two hours later they'd break for an hour-long lunch\nbreak. And at 5 p.m. it would be \"pack-up\". That too was agreeable to Goldie. He\nassured Dadamoni that his schedule would be followed to the minute. On the first\nday Dev Anand and Ashok Kumar were on the sets at 11 a.m. sharp. But there was\nno sign of the film's heroine, Vyjayantimala. An assistant was sent to her every\nquarter of an hour. Finally, at 12.30 he returned with the message that madam\ndidn't want to be disturbed, she'd come when she was ready. At ten minutes to\none she strolled in asking sweetly, \"Am I late?\" Goldie surprised her by calling\nfor a lunch break. Vyjayantimala was furious. \"Your assistant has been badgering\nme for the last two hours and now when I'm here you announce a break,\" she\nraged. Goldie was unfazed. \"Our most senior artiste is not a very healthy\nperson. We have to follow his schedule. You have to be on the set early,\" he\nreminded her. Vyjayantimala never forgot the \"slight\". For the rest of the film,\nGoldie insists, she nursed a khunnas against him. There were some date problems\nand many distractions but Vyjayantimala being the professional that she was,\nstill came up with a polished performance. Goldie's only grievance is that she\ncould have done better with Hoton pe aisi baat. \"I wanted her to rehearse the\nnumber before we went for a final take. But she told me airily that she didn't\nneed any rehearsals. I insisted she did, but she still didn't report for\nrehearsals and came straight to the set. I called for \"pack-up\" and told her\nfirmly that she had to stay back in the studio and practise with the assistants.\nShe did practise, for 15 minutes. Then she got into her car and drove off saying\nthat Saroj Khan would be coming to her place later and they'd go over the steps\ntogether. The rehearsal never happened but Vyjayantimala being a good actress\nand an excellent dancer didn't find it too difficult to pick up the steps and\nthe shots were okayed quickly. But I could never establish the kind of rapport I\nhad with Mumtaz, Waheeda, Hema and Raakhee, with Vyjayantimala,\" Goldie rues",

It seems like the main goal was a gorefest, but a more interesting (and less derivative) tale could certainly have been told -- if anyone involved cared (but they didn't). The pacing was not great; the film often dragged.The first act is the most interesting, as we're trying to figure out what's going on. The rest of the film slowly devolves into supernatural horror (possession and murder). I didn't like many of the characters, and it's hard to feel sympathy for people who aren't behaving or communicating well (even when lives depend on following rules and sharing information).The cultural differences were mildly interesting -- at first -- but when the film got into gory-exorcism mode the disgusting happenings dominated (but not in a good way). I also found the use of seemingly generic prayers (by exorcists) to accomplish very specific goals quite unconvincing. Not sure if this was to avoid offending certain people.I don't recommend this unless you specifically like Malaysian horror. I give it 3.5 stars, with half-star penalties for excessive gore, missed opportunities, and poor pacing. That's two (2) stars total.",

            "storyline": "Fact: In 1902 theater director and actor Konstantin Stanislavsky put on stage in the Moscow Art Theater two plays by Maxim Gorky whose scenarios were slums. As part of the preparation for the actors, he took the company to the Khitrov Market in Moscow. At that time, the Khitrov was a rather dangerous place teeming with thieves, prostitutes and murderers and approached with caution even by the police.The movie takes this episode as starting point, although shows Stanislavsky in the Kitrov without the theater troupe, in the only company of journalist Vladimir Gilyarovsky who is familiar with the slum (as Stanislavsky, Gilyarovsky is a real life character and the script is partly based on his writings).At this point, the film transitions into a rather free version of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novella The Sign of Four, with Stanislavsky as a version of Holmes and Gilyarovsky as Dr Watson. There are also counterparts of Professor Moriarty and Inspector Lestrade. The last part of the film introduces some comedic elements. There is a little name dropping; Count Tolstoy is mentioned and playwright Anton Chekhov is given a conversation with Stanislavsky in a luxury restaurant. There is a nice plot twist near the end. The literal translation of the Russian title is Cunning: The Sign of Four.I didn't find the idea of Stanislavsky as an amateur detective particularly compelling. The film is generally entertaining, but its strong point is the reconstruction of the Kitrov at that time; set and costume design are outstanding and cinematography is excellent both depicting the slums and the aristocratic/intellectual milieu where Stanislavsky lived and worked. All in all, not an outstanding work but an entertaining tale.",
