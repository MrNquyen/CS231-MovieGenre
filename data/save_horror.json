In Finn's words, \"I really, in building this pop star of Skye Riley played by Naomi Scott, wanted to lend credibility to the character and sort of blur the lines between reality and fiction and make her feel almost like she really existed in our world. And so I had this idea of introducing her on a talk show, but I was like, I want to do a real talk show.\" Drew Barrymore has been hosting The Drew Barrymore Show since 2020, and Parker Finn said he wrote the early scene with her in mind. He wrote to her, including the script pages, hoping that she might take the part, and he was delighted to get a yes. The writer/director continued: \"I love Drew Barrymore and I wrote the scene and then I sent it to her and I also wrote a letter to her and she was so gracious and said yes, and it was it was such a like fun dream to get to work with her and to do that.\"",

He later suggested that there may even be a fourth prequel film. However, the future of the series became uncertain after the purchase of 20th Century Fox by Disney in December 2017. The next film, tentatively titled 'Alien: Awakening', was set to enter preproduction that same month, but according to some sources, the project was shelved indefinitely. The commercial underperformance of Alien: Covenant as well as its lukewarm reception by critics and fans were named as reasons, although no official statements were made by Disney. In early 2019, however, the script called Alien: Awakening was actively being written, and Untitled Alien Prequel was officially in production as of 2022.",

But there was nothing scary about it at all and there were no scary special effects. I was hoping it would be as entertaining as Gonjiam Asylum or even Grave Encounters but this was just lame. I hope Jenni tries again at making a scary movie because I think she is great! Hopefully this was a good learning experience for her.",

Theres an interesting angle about how vulnerable we really are in a cab driven by someone we know nothing about but that isn't really the purpose of the story, although the depth in Frost's performance did make me think.Shot in the dark and taking place in a single night with a significant proportion inside a London cab, there's some good use of light. A couple of jump scares and some creepy exposition delivered nicely by Frost give the film just enough atmosphere to keep you engaged.My favourite part was the ending which is a little ambiguous and probably open to some interpretation.Overall though I thought it was pretty average fare.",

It was surreal, because they would bus you in in the middle of the night, so you couldn't see any of the country. They would just drop you in this resort compound, which was in fact surrounded by a razor-wire fence. You couldn't leave, much like in the film, and there was a kind of fake town where you could go shopping. The Chinese restaurant and the horrible discotheque in the movie are both based on that actual resort; the scene with the man on the ATV on the beach being chased by guards actually happened. And then, at the end of the week, they bused you back during the day, and you could see the actual immediate surrounding country, which was very poverty-stricken. There were people living in shacks. That contrast was obviously horrible, but also surreal, because you realized you had never actually entered the country; you were just dropped into this strange pocket of a sort of alternate dimension that had just grown up to become this tacky Disneyland mirror image of reality.\"",

McConaughey suggested two friends from acting class and left. He was about to get in his truck and drive to California when he stopped and realized, \"What was I thinking?\" He immediately turned around and asked Henkel, \"Hey, can I audition for Vilmer?\" Henkel gave him a spoon from the kitchen, told him to pretend it's a knife and tasked him with scaring his secretary.

They would contract a big-name movie star to appear in their movie for one day, for a few frontal shots only, while the rest of the scenes were done with a double filmed from the back. A picture of the big star would then be placed prominently on the movie's poster in order to boost sales. (Example: Bruce Willis' character of Lieutenant Muldoon is never in the same frame with the other actors, indicating that all of his scenes were filmed separately.) Ironically, many of Willis's later appearances in films (especially during the 2020s), such as Corrective Measures (2022) were authentic versions of this, where Willis essentially played a small part in limited scenes but was billed prominently for marketing purposes.",

The movie made me think - about a possible future about the unstoppable ... row of time.Not really a feel good sentimentality I am putting out there. But it is what it is - which is also true about the story the movie offers - as in predictable! I don't even think you have to have watched many movies to get where this is going.The characters seem to need a bit longer to get the obvious I reckon. One of the actors doing double duty (well actually the mother in a way too, but differently, as in being only one character) ... and the one character he is playing is quite out there .... the main characters make fun of him - but not sure that is enough to make away the cringe you may feel.A few good shockers, a few completely unnecessary scenes (a signing that really has no merit and no excuse being in the movie - unless there is some deleted footage that would tie or explain its existence) ... overall it does have the right themes and might give you a horrible feeling ... just maybe not the one you were looking for ...",

Another goddamn stand-up comedian here to make fun of us at our sacred rituals.' Well, I'll have you know, I'm not such an outsider. I am quite sought after in the film world. I would like to share with you a real email that I got from my agents about thirty days ago. This is an actual email that they sent me on December 7th, [2023,] so you'll get an idea of who you're dealing with. 'John, in anticipation of our conversation, attached please find the untitled Maggie Gyllenhaal project written and to be directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.' That makes sense. 'Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Osnat Handelsman[-Keren], and Talia Kleinhendler are attached to produce for Warner Brothers. Christian Bale is negotiating to star opposite Jessie Buckley.' I know who one of those people is. 'There is no script available at this time.' Okay, I'm listening. 'Pending, pending your response to the material. Please use the attached sides to put yourself on tape for the role of Young Cop.' Let's, thank you. They really sent this to me. WME [the entertainment agency William Morris Endeavor] sent this to me, let me be clear. I'm not being OFFERED Young Cop. They're giving me the chance to throw my hat in the ring. And yes, I put myself on tape, and, no, I didn't get it, but. . . . Let's stop focusing on failure, all right? Enough failure. Tonight, there are only winners.\"",

In addition to producing the creature effects, Cosmatos trusted Winston to direct the second unit action sequences. \"George Cosmatos always let us take the lead in how to shoot the creature,\" noted Landon. \"He was such a big-hearted person, he would throw up his hands, and say 'I don't know what I'm doing.' He'd just admit it and let us do what we knew how to do. We know what our characters can do and we know the best way to use them. We're thinking about what our characters are going to have to do on the set the entire time we're building them. So we are goldmines of information and knowledge.

Identical twin girls were initially cast, but as late as two days before filming was about to start, Pattinson couldn't bond with them, as they wouldn't stop crying as soon as he picked them up and got upset every time they were without their mother. He and Claire Denis felt not ready to shoot with them because the final film would have ended up entirely different. The night before filming began, Pattinson had the idea to ask his friend the last minute and so they flew in from London the next morning. She actually took her first steps ever infront of the camera while filming.",

Whenever the audience would laugh at one of her lines she could not differentiate whether they were laughing at her personally or the character. The experience forever marred Wilsey on a personal level and she soon afterwards resigned herself to pursue a career exclusively in the adult entertainment industry.",

And probably that not many women that young and attractive are very interested in going out with a father in the middle of a separation with a very young child, but what do I know?If you get past that - and suspend belief that said father would not be suspicious about a woman who looked like Rachel Cook oozing over him - the movie is very much fun. Ron Perlman is not going to win an Academy Award for his performance, but the character was fun - I spent a lot of the movies trying to figure out whose side he was really on.The succubus mythology was interesting and the final ending both surprising and foreshadowed.An altogether competent bit of fun.",

Maddy Smith, being very British, was a little more nervous about prancing around in the nude. So we had a closed set. Producers Harry Fine and Michael Style were a bit peeved about this because they were barred from set too. They thought it was producer's perks to watch what was going on. Then one day I was walking to the set wearing just a dressing gown with nothing on underneath when I saw them coming in the opposite direction wearing a doleful look. As I went past them I open my dressing gown and said, Wheeeee! There was a spring in their step as they went on their way.\"",

In a meeting to discuss ways to reduce the budget, Miller volunteered to give up his trailer because he was always needed on the set and had no time to use it. The studio concluded that he was a pushover, so they began to interfere with his production requests. If he asked for fifty extras, the studio would provide a dozen. If he asked for two cameras, they would provide one. Miller decided to fight fire with fire, and refused to shoot each scene until his production demands were met. The studio responded by looking for a new director, but were prevented by Jack Nicholson, who supported Miller and vowed to walk off the production if he was replaced.",

While described as a horror film it is not that scary, it is more a mixture of suspense, mystery, scifi and thriller. It was filmed in Mudgee and NSW Central Coast but could be set in any rural town.The story line was a bit hard to follow in terms of what is flashbacks, imagination, ghosts, the brain implant and current actual real life.The main character of. Anna played by Megan Bell carries the film and did an outstanding job,the small role of John Barnes played by Shaun Foley looks like he belongs in a Christmas romance movie or action thriller. The character of the best friend Sophie I just found annoying.I have seen it twice, the first was at a pre release screening at Avoca. This was indoors with a high resolution projection in comfortable surroundings. The second was at the.outdoor premier in Mudgee with a lower resolution projection and falling temparature.For a small budget locally made film it was great, just wish I understood the story more.

I was really intrigued by the family dynamic, the daughters, the nature of grief, this doctor who's essentially someone that's composed and tries not to panic, found himself doing just that,\" Elba tells Complex about the survival thriller directed by Baltasar Kormákur. \"I just love the script. I love Baltasar, the director. I wanted to work with him. He's made some really incredible survivor movies, and I just wanted to get his take on what this might be like.\"",

Lake Mungo is a dry lake, and an important archaeological site. In 1968, the remains of a young Aboriginal woman were uncovered and she was nicknamed the \"Mungo Lady\". She was found to be ritually buried, and her bones were approximately 40,000 years old at the time of discovery. Mungo Lady is one of the earliest anatomically modern human remains discovered anywhere in the world. Five years later, another skeleton of around 40,000 years old was found at Lake Mungo, and named \"Mungo Man\".",

Among its better features is the strong and generally effective setup that provides this with a lot of likable factors. The main feature involving the genre mashup about the down-on-their-luck team of friends trying to relive their glory years in a failing stripping troupe but unable to recognize what's happening to their lives because all they have is the group so the need for taking the mysterious gig is a major opportunity for them to take. That brings about the early stages where the group's delight at the presentations and different pleasantries waiting for them while waiting for the show is a lot of fun making the setup rather enjoyable as we also get the darker features involving the secret activity of their charges making the plans for the sacrifice. These are bent together quite well and make everything come together rather nicely in a strong overall setup that allows the series of more intriguing haunting action to have a lot of fun here. Featuring the generally fun starting point of the suspected dance going awry and realizing that the entire thing with the strange job and bizarre conditions for everything was a ruse for their impending sacrifice in a ritual to resurrect a long-dead witch the coven worships, there's a fantastic amount of fun here involving the bizarre antics presented within here. As the coven tries to keep their own members in line when they begin questioning everything since these distractions allow a chance for the men to gather themselves and escape, the ensuing scenes of them bring based around the club encountering not just the revived witch with very specific means of trying to gather the rest of the group in her power but the other coven members trying to help her in carrying out their deadly plans. Featuring some great practical effects for the kills, solid laughs with the wild situation, and a fun pace that holds everything together, this one has plenty to like about it. There are some issues here that bring this one down. Among its few drawbacks is the unnecessary and dragging plot-point about the daughter being involved in the ceremony when she has no reason to be there. The whole thing reeks of trying to create a sense of tension by having a secret child involved in the coven that adds a wrinkle to the experience just for the sake of adding one which is the wrong way of going about this, much like the idea of using it to bring about an attempt at parenting commentary on the situation but everything here is just not that interesting to see a parental relationship like this play out in the middle of what's going on. The other factor here is the confusing reason why the traitor turns to the group for help with this section providing another unnecessary means of keeping this going by providing something to quibble over before the final confrontation. Otherwise, there's not much else to hold this one down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",

More than that there are some poorly executed effects that actually ruin all the best parts, i belive the ending editing could have been done much better. I would say it is mediocrate, but actors tried their best. Would i recommend it for a Halloween watch? Not likely but I have seen worse than that, so if u are into this concept you could probably try to watch it and i think you'll end up with exact same thoughts i have.",

Mou filmed the movie in Harbin, Manchuria where 731 was stationed. He used 731's real headquarters as a location, it was a school at the time of the shoot. When Mou took down the school's name and put the Japanese flag back, it horrified the local elderly who had lived through the war. One particularly upset old lady approached Mou and his crew and said \"I knew they'd be back (the Japanese), I just hoped it wouldn't be this soon!\"",

The press was fitted with foam pads (which resemble the casting molds in the press) and there were chocks put in the center to stop it from closing completely. However, the machine was powerful enough to crush the chocks that it gradually kept closing. It is commonly believed that Finley pulled his head out of the press just in time to avoid being injured, and that his scream in that scene was genuine, but this is an exaggeration. Finley was quickly pulled out by grips and the record press scene, along with most scenes in the movie with little dialogue, was filmed without sound, and the talking and sound effects were dubbed in later. At a Phantom of the Paradise convention, Finley exaggerated the story and said that his scream was \"for real\", although he may have meant that he was able to conjure up a very real scream in post-production by thinking back to his memories of the incident.",

The dangerous stunt involved her driving a motorcycle towards a camera mounted on a crane, while she wore no helmet as the shot required her not to. The crane malfunctioned and didn't move out of the way in time. Noticing this, she tried (and failed) to block it with her arm. She received several serious life threatening injuries including a twisted spine, broken discs, brain bleeding, shattered scapula, nerves torn, leaking cerebral fluid, degloved face (which is when facial skin is ripped off to reveal muscle tissue and teeth), shattered eye socket which had to be put together with tweezers, cheekbone shard stabbing her ear drum, fingers torn from her hand, an entire bone ripped out of her arm. Her left arm, which suffered these injuries, was injured so badly it had to be amputated. She was put into a medically induced coma for 17 days to perform all of the surgeries. Paul W.S. Anderson was so devastated by the accident that he nearly quit the project, while Milla Jovovich visited Jackson in the hospital and brought her flowers. Jackson sued (and won) the production company for the workplace injuries, as she was initially only compensated $33,000 for the injuries.",

When you're watching the movie, if you look at the part where I take the gun out of the purse, before I come out into the parking lot, I grab a sheet off the bed. We did this many times with the sheet, and it just wasn't working, so I said, 'Forget the sheet, I am leaving the sheet behind.' So that's how I ended up getting so much more nude. I said, 'Forget it, if you want this, I'm going to go balls to the walls and here it is.'\" She added \"Because, as an actor, I just felt a lot better forgetting the sheet. I felt like it was more real. I felt like I was in my reality. I was, like, 'I would not be worrying about this stupid sheet right now! I just want the tape back.'\"",

In it, a spiteful mother beheads her stepson and blames it on her daughter. She then cooks the corpse and feeds it to his husband, as the daughter picks up the bones from under the table and plants it under a juniper tree on the family's garden. A small bird appears from the grave, singing the song in question while picking a pair of new shoes, a gold chain and a mill stone, and then carries them to the house. The bird then gives the shoes to the daughter, the chain to the father and drops the stone on the stepmother, killing her. As she dies, the bird turns into a boy again and the story ends. The film borrows some thematic elements this tale.",

First is the design of her wardrobe: the producers found her breasts visually inadequate, and so designed her costumes to emphasize her buttocks instead. Second is her eye injury: the material exploding from a prop gun scratched her cornea painfully. Because of this, whenever she had to fire a prop gun on Babylon 5 (1993) she would instinctively turn her face away when pulling the trigger, even though this was unnecessary because the Babylon 5 prop guns did not really fire, as all visual effects were to be added in later.",

Director Barbara Peeters, who was a feminist who hated that idea, refused to shoot the scenes. Corman said he'd hire a second director and get her feedback before using the new footage. She agreed to that. But Corman ended up never showing the new footage to her or the cast and other crew. They didn't see them until the preview of the film. Peeters was furious, protesting that they were inserted purely to show gratuitous nudity. Corman also edited out many of the scenes dealing with the plot and character development in order to make room for the nudity and more creature scenes. Peeters complained that it was no longer the film she made and wanted her name taken off. Corman said he'd do that but only if she paid the expense of redoing the credits. She wouldn't, so her name stayed on the project. Many years later, Peeters ended up watching the film on cable and admitted it actually ended up being \"a fun little movie.\"",

The actors and cinematographers did a pretty good job with what they had to work with, which is why I gave it two stars instead of zero.I will preface that maybe the second half of the film is better than the first, but by the 60 minute mark I was bored out of my mind and stopped watching.

They don't earn all the crazyness, but this movie knows how to do pacing very well. Some might find it a tad to slow but for me these are my favorite horror movies, taking there time to sink there teeth into you.Also its caustrophobic, it takes place pretty much mostly in one small trailer home and it works very well doing it like that.

The latter complained that early footage of the film wasn't scary enough, and would frequently visit the set to make unreasonable demands about what should be shot, deviating away from the script. When that did not solve the matter, Weinstein threatened to fire del Toro and replace him with another director. However, del Toro was saved by the intervention of Mira Sorvino, who was a recent Oscar winner for Mighty Aphrodite (1995) (produced by Weinstein's company Miramax). She threatened to quit the film if del Toro's vision wasn't respected, and she received support from her then-boyfriend Quentin Tarantino, who has made several films for Miramax. The Weinsteins finally agreed to let del Toro stay on, but they oversaw the final cut of the film. Since then, del Toro has never worked with the Weinsteins again, but he made his peace with the film after creating a Director's Cut that was closer to his vision.",

I made my partner drive with me upstate, and we spent New Year's bumming around Saugerties quietly, mapping out the path and figuring out exactly how to time it so that I could start filming at 11:57 and hit the center of town right as the countdown actually began. It really was this 'You get one shot' sort of deal.\nI had gone to an Airbnb up in Saugerties over New Year's a couple years earlier. I was sick as a dog, spent that entire weekend lying around feeling terrible and didn't leave this Airbnb for three days except at midnight. I staggered out, went to the town and saw this very charming, small-town version of the Times Square ball drop. After I saw that, I was like, 'I need to work that into a movie someday.' The idea that Casey would be there filming was one of the early ideas for this film. The loneliness of being in a crowd of people and feeling like you can say whatever you want because no one is listening, or is even aware you're there, is a big part of that scene. Also, so many of the kids hanging around half a block away from the center of that party we were filming WERE Casey. It was like, 'Oh yeah, there are Caseys EVERYWHERE in towns like this.'\"",

Next up, a guy is at a bar saying farewell to his fellow cops as he must retire to take care of his wife, who is in a wheelchair for some unexplained reason. Eight years ahead, the boy who was missing with mom calls his dad from a payphone. Most of the characters are hillbillies behaving badly with drugs and alcohol and an inexplicable gay sex interlude which seems to be from gay porn.

The most difficult part was when the pods burst open, revealing the likenesses of the actors. The actors had to have naked impressions of themselves made out of thin, skin-tight latex. Making the casts, which involved being submerged in the very hot casting material with only a straw in their mouths to breathe through, was grueling for the actors, especially Carolyn Jones, who was claustrophobic. Dana Wynter recalled, \"I was in this thing while it hardened, and of course it got rather warm! I was breathing through straws or something quite bizarre, and the rest of me was encased, it was like a sarcophagus. The guys who were making it tapped on the back of the thing and said, 'Dana, listen, we won't be long, we're just off for lunch [laughs]!' In the end, we had to be covered except for just the nostrils and I think a little aperture for the mouth.\"",

There is a sequence involving an elevator shaft. We knew we couldn't film it in a real elevator shaft, so we had to figure out how to shoot something like that. There are always those types of creative challenges. Also, finding US Army vehicles in the middle of Budapest isn't the easiest thing to do! We managed to find a Humvee from Romania, which belonged to a private collector, and drove it to the locations. You write things like these into scripts so easily without thinking about how you're going to pull them off. It's only when you get into production that you start to think, 'Oh, what was I thinking when I wrote that.' We only have ourselves to blame at the end of the day!\"",

Director John Carpenter had a house in Inverness for several years, so the location was essentially his second home at that time (as the director puts it, \"his own backyard\"). However, the locals were not happy to see the film crew in the area so they made the shoot very difficult by harassment and vandalism. Carpenter tells that while they were filming, for example, a sound take, a neighbor would start mowing his lawn or start up a chainsaw until he was paid to stop. Some of the people even tried to break into the equipment trucks. The whole experience essentially soured Carpenter on living in the area, where several scenes of his earlier film \"The Fog (1980)\" were also filmed.",

            "storyline": "This was a film that I got the chance to see via screener thanks to Shirly from Studio Dome Press. What intrigued me was the title as I knew this was going to be a Christmas horror film. It seemed as well that this was going to be a slasher as well. I've seen more films that fall in this sub-genre and use this niche, so I was curious as to what we'd get here as the holiday season approaches.Synopsis: Chester returns to his home after seeing his parents' murders 17 years ago by a killer dressed as Santa. A new Santa killer begins picking off his relatives. Chester questions if the original has returned or if a more terrifying truth exists.We started this back in the late-50s or the early 60s. We're in the home of Nathan Van Buren (Scott Bolger). He's there with his wife, Lila (Reagan Kelly). Upstairs is their son, Chester (Will Pealer Jr.). His uncle, Nick (Scot Spurlock), is telling him stories. Chester wants one more and things get dark. It makes the boy uneasy. This ominous feeling grows as over the radio they hear about a serial killer who escapes from prison. What I'll say here is that Chester's parents are murdered and he sees it.This then shifts to 1980. It is December 23rd. Chester is now an adult, played by David Lenik. He meets with his doctor, Landry (Nicholas Vince), who thinks he's ready for release. There is a regiment of medication he must take to help keep his nightmares and visions in check. Chester leaves and outside is his girlfriend who is waiting. Her name is Afton (Nellie Spackman). They're heading to the house that everything happened in to spend the holidays.Staying at this house is his Aunt Marion (Caroline Williams). Her son, Burke (Cedric Gegel), is also there with his girlfriend, Melody (Natalie Veater). Burke is a jerk so we see Chester and him take shots at each other. He goes outside to get away from him and gets a pleasant surprise. When he was a child, he was friends with a neighbor named Eden (Peyton Michelle Edwards). She brings home wood for a fire with her stepfather, Dick Galveston (Tom Moynahan). Chester and Eden plan to see each other the next day.Our lead starts to question his sanity that night as he finds a note from the killer in his room. When he tries to show it to the others, it is gone. This makes us wonder, was it there? Things aren't as they seem here though and not everyone cares about Chester as well as his mental state. There is a person in a Santa suit that is lingering around. Is this someone who is trying to crack Chester or is this killer back?That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is confirming that this is a slasher film that has someone in a Santa outfit as the killer. What comes along with that is that we have kills to start this movie then it slows down to set up the situation as well as our characters. It is a slow burn until things ramp up to the climax. If you know me, I'm not always the biggest fan of this style of film, unless you have good characters or kills. The ones with both tend to be my favorites. I'll go into what my thoughts were.Where I want to start then would be with the story. This opening sequence is borrowing from Silent Night, Deadly Night where Uncle Nick warns Chester about being asleep on Christmas or Santa might kill you. I do love that mean-spirited idea, especially to set the tone here. It is from there that it feels a bit like Cult of Chucky where we have these family members who don't have the best interests at heart for Chester and we don't know who all is in on the plot. When people start to die, I even got vibes of My Bloody Valentine where Chester is convinced this killer is back, but there could be more to what is happening. I'm not comparing this as a slight, because to be honest, credit to them for borrowing elements that work to craft this story. They work seamlessly.I do have a gripe here that hurts the pacing for me. There are a few times where we have characters just telling stories to help fill in backstory. Chester tells things to Afton. This is the first information dump. Then from there, another time was Eden and Chester talking, to let us know that they were friends as kids. There was another one or even two that we got. It just was bogged down with dialogue there. I prefer being shown over being told, but I get why we can't every time. Just something that didn't necessarily work here for me. Fans of this sub-genre might feel the same.Let's then delve into what I look for with the characters. The acting performances are fine. Lenik is a bit wooden, but I'm forgiving. He is mentally unstable. He is on medication so I just figure that he's not as used to interacting with people. It is a rough time for him which would make sense. Edwards is cute and I like her as the only one who seems to have Chester's best interests at heart. She is interesting though since Chester does have a girlfriend. Spackman is fine there. She is more interesting as we learn about her. Gegel fits as this jerk cousin. Veater was also solid as his girlfriend. She isn't given much to work with. I did like seeing Williams as well as Lauren-Marie Taylor having cameos here. The rest of the cast are fine. There are characters here for cannon fodder, which I appreciate.All that is left then is filmmaking. I'll need to talk about the kills here, because this goes brutal at times. Our killer is using an ax, which I did like to see. I also love that there are Christmas related items used to kill people. That adds charm and character. I'll say that the cinematography and framing were good to help hide the seams since they went practical with everything I can see. That's another perk. They don't use the time it is set all that much, but I know it is set in the 80s to not need technology. I'm glad it isn't in your face as it has a timeless feel. Other than that, the soundtrack didn't stand out. I'm surprised they didn't use more holiday music, but I'm also glad they didn't go over the top.In conclusion, this is a solid lower budget slasher with the Christmas theme. We are getting elements from other movies that fall in this sub-genre, but I did like how they're used here. This is well made enough. I thought that the cinematography, framing and effects were good to make the kills look good. The acting was solid. No one is great, but I don't have a gripe there either. Even though I'm not a big slasher fan, I did enjoy my time here. I would recommend giving this a viewing to fans of these types of movies.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",

In the DVD featurette Crashing a Coach (2007), director Christopher Smith goes into detail about how the crash scene was staged, and in it, he points out how the Hungarian stunt team were \"less concerned with health and safety issues\" than British stunt teams. Smith explains that for the crash scene, the stunt coordinator told Boros to drive at 35mph, but Boros felt this wouldn't produce a good enough scene, so he hit the stunt ramp at 50mph, producing a much more spectacular crash than Smith wanted. As it was a one-time only shot, this newly spectacular crash forced a hasty rewriting of the screenplay, as due to the severity of the crash, the characters now needed to be substantially more injured than was originally planned. Smith was also amazed that the only safety equipment Boros used during the scene was a seat belt and a motorcycle helmet. Indeed, during the stunt, Boros was knocked completely unconscious.",

After taking a bribe from a local hunter, Eladio's normal life falls apart, plunging him into the depths of guilt, hatred, and revenge.A pretty well executed Spanish slow burner that definitely deserve some attentions from then genre fans.",

Fox had individually numbered each reel, as well as a final security measure. Fox Executive Vice President and Sales Manager Richard Myerson stated it was \"to ensure everyone's enjoyment of the film and to prevent 'spoilers', we've instituted extraordinary measures.

It includes vivid physical descriptions of the characters that often differ greatly from the actors' onscreen appearance, as well as in-depth backstories for several characters, including secondary characters who receive little screen time. The book also leaves it a mystery until far later in the narrative as to what happened to Billy's parents, and also continues on past the movie's ending, wrapping up the stories of several characters whose fates are not addressed in the film's epilogue.",

Yeah, not exactly a horror comedy, especially since the movie was frightfully devoid of anything funny. Sure, the movie was watchable, but I had expected quite something else than what it turned out to be.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, aside from actor Chaleumpol Tikumpornteerawong, but I will say that the acting performances were good. And I do enjoy watching unfamiliar talents on the screen.Visually, then \"Anong\" was an okay movie. It wasn't heavy on special effects, nor overly reliant on the special effects to carry the narrative. But the effects were adequate and helped bring the ghostly characters to life on the screen. But I've seen better effects in other Thai ghost movies.Watchable for what it was, but this was hardly an outstanding Thai movie. Nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.My rating of director Komgrit Triwimol's 2024 supernatural romance lands on a five out of ten stars.",

There's a moment when she looks and sees bats going into the tree and you could think that maybe there's something in there, in the same way that bats were apparently the reason that COVID-19 kicked in. There are little references like that but image of a single tree in this sort of muddy little swamp to me was really creepy and intriguing and asks a lot of questions. There are little subtle things like there's a moment in the beginning when you see a picture from the people who lived in this house like a hundred years ago and it's the same tree but that tree is in blossom and alive, so it's died over the years and maybe it's become this kind of place where bad stuff lives. I would like to keep a little mystery in the story. I think the best kind of horror lives in between spots and it's not overly explained because if you over explain the monster then the monster loses its power to scare you. We did at one point flirted with the idea of seeing something in there like seeing a humanoid shape but I just felt in the end it's more interesting to let the audience ask that question whether they have an answer to it or not. There had to be a kind of reason why this kid gets infected, some sort of explanation, but you don't want to go too far with that, at least in my mind. I think it's better to have a little ambiguity in the story.\"",

It was the producers who made her nervous. Shot in Mexico with no parents or chaperones at her side, the script called for the actress to appear topless, which she agreed to because she had no issue taking off her top in front of cast and crew. She'd already done it in The Last American Virgin (1982). But when producers tried to persuade her to go fully nude, she balked and successfully stood her ground. \"They said I was beautiful and they really wanted me to do it. I said thank you very much but no.\" Franklin laughed. \"They got around it by shooting me from the back, which I had no say in. And that was that.\"",

Should I bring it for the production? Maybe we could use it.' We knew immediately how that would fit into our general approach to the photography of the movie. The photography should feel like an omniscient presence in the movie. It should feel very subjective, almost like a third, all-powerful character. So Will came out with the drone and, after almost getting arrested with it in a Moscow airport because they were thinking it was a piece of military equipment he was going to assault Russia with, we got to use it. Any day the crew was off, [co-director/cinematographer] Aaron Moorhead and I would continue to shoot. On Sundays in Italy, we'd continue shooting and that was when we'd do the drone photography with Will. Just grab as many shots as we could, experiment with it, see how it would work. And almost everything we shot with the drone made it into the edit. It's one of the talking points of the movie. It's pretty cool. It's one of those things where one day, because a lot of people have started using them and someday people are going to look at our movie and be like, 'Why did Moorhead and Benson use the fucking toy helicopter thing over and over and over again?'\"[2014]",

Furthermore, due to special effects house Digital Domain considering a partnership with MGM, production was supposed to get a discount on the special effects, but when that deal fell through, they had to pay for \"the full spa treatment\", and about half of the planned shots had to be scrapped. Hill also disagreed with MGN on their decision to screen his first cut without many of the effects shots for a test audience (which, as he predicted, was a disaster), and their refusal to allow for additional filming (which had to be done anyway after Hill walked out). In an interview years after the release, Hill said that his version was much darker, had a very different setup and that the ending was much different from the final cut. He also expressed strong dislike for the way the studio ruined the movie but said that James Spader did a great job with his role.",

However, due to the amount of money that had already been spent, MGM insisted that the film be finished and released as scheduled for June of 1988 or they would find someone else to do it. Apparently, after the film was given a PG rating by the MPAA in November 1987, the studio had already decided to have Sherman re-shoot the ending with more graphic scenes, in order to \"up\" the rating to PG-13. Planning for this re-shoot began in December 1987 and continued into January 1988, but was temporarily put on hold when O'Rourke died Feb. 1. The re-shoot (which used a stand-in for Heather) eventually took place in March, and the film was then \"re-edited\" and given a PG-13 by the MPAA in April 1988. Director Sherman would later claim that no such \"re-shoot\" took place, instead insisting that Heather died before they could film the \"original ending\" and that the current ending using the body double was what they hastily threw together when forced to \"finish\" the film by MGM. However, he is contradicted by at least six other people who also worked on the film who confirmed that the original ending was in fact filmed before Heather died and that the re-shoot of the ending took place after her passing. These people include producer Barry Bernardi, actor Kipley Wentz, assistant editor Jeanne Bonansinga, composer Joe Renzetti, special effects makeup artist Doug Drexler and the man who provided the voice for the Rev. Kane, Corey Burton. His claims would ultimately be proven false by the Collector's Edition Blu-ray release by Scream Factory, where the original film elements and the missing footage were discovered in a vault for a 4K restoration, including the original ending which Sherman denied ever existed. This Blu-ray release, as of 2020, has since gone out of print.",

I mean, what exactly would you expect if you ate and took on the sins of another, but I really think people should know what they are getting into when they watch a movie about something like that. Let's face it, if another Friday the 13th came out, wouldn't it be predictable that Jason would kill a bunch of people, get killed in the end, but not really killed? All of that being said, I found Curse of the Sin Eater to be a worthwhile watch.

Unfortunately I had commitments, I had some commercials to shoot. But anyway I took it over with barely ten days of preparation - which shows. It doesn't become my picture, it's a bit inbetween . . . [actor Oliver Reed was] scary at first because he was always testing you all the time. Difficult but not as difficult as Klaus Kinski. Because Oliver [Reed] actually had a sense of humour. I was rather fond of him; he could be tricky but he was quite warm really. He just played games and was rather macho and so on. Klaus Kinski was very cold. The main problem with the film was that the two didn't get on and they fought like cats. Kinski of course is a fabulous film actor and he's good in the part, the part suits him very well. They were both well cast but it was a very unhappy film. I think Klaus was the problem but then Oliver spent half the movie just trying to rub him up, pulling his leg all the way. There were shouting matches because Oliver just wouldn't let up. None of this is about art. All the things that you're trying to concentrate on tend to slip. So it was not a happy period.\"",

They hoped they would abuse the house in making a horror movie. They wanted the house, which was in poor shape, to be condemned so they could tear it down because it was so expensive to maintain. The production company restored the plumbing, the electric and other repairs so the crew could stay in it while the movie was being made. The repairs help save the house from the wrecking ball. The heirs ended up selling the property to the Westchester County Historical Society for $15 million dollars, the home was restored over the years and it is now part of the New York Historical Parks and Sites.

A bit of a nod to Alien set in a poorly lit warehouse and a guy trying to escape a couple of gangsters and finding they were the least of his worries.The ending to this was quite clever.The other three each had their moments and overall it was nicely shot.Rufus Hound as a swinger and Bill Fellows as the night watchman in #1 were well known names but the rest of the cast not so.But everyone did a good solid job.The TVIFF has been showcasing new talent all week and this a very good example of what can be achieved even without Hollywood style funding.Well done to all involved.",

Romero). After the series' great success, just roughly three short years after Creepshow 2 hit theatres, Tales from the Darkside: The Movie came to fruition in 1990 as the successor to the original two Creepshow installments, sharing many of the same crew as the Creepshow installments.",

            "storyline": "\"Kalinga\" is a bold attempt by director and lead actor Dhruva Vaayu, showcasing his passion for horror cinema despite the constraints of a limited budget. The film revolves around a protagonist's unsettling experiences as he delves into a sinister mystery that unfolds in a rural backdrop.What Worked:\nVaayu's effort to create a captivating narrative with limited resources is commendable. The film has a few chilling sequences that effectively build tension, particularly in the first half. The background score, though clearly inspired by well-known horror motifs, manages to elevate the atmosphere in crucial scenes. The cinematography deserves praise for capturing the eerie essence of the locations, adding depth and visual appeal to the film.Pragya Nayan, who plays the female lead, brings a strong presence to the screen. With the right choice of scripts in the future, she has the potential to make a mark in the industry.What Could Have Been Better:\nHowever, Kalinga falls short in several areas. The demon makeup is unfortunately subpar, often breaking the immersion when it appears on screen. The screenplay lacks coherence, feeling more like a collection of disjointed scenes rather than a unified story. Some of the best moments seem like snippets borrowed from other films or short films, leading to an overall lack of originality and depth.The film also struggles with connecting its plot points, leaving several threads unexplained or unresolved by the end. This absence of a strong conclusion diminishes the impact of the mystery that Kalinga tries to build. The background score, while effective at times, is noticeably influenced by other works, which detracts from its authenticity.Final Thoughts:\nOverall, Kalinga is an average horror flick that has its moments but fails to live up to its potential. Vaayu's direction shows promise, but the film is ultimately let down by its poor execution in makeup and storytelling. For horror enthusiasts, it might be worth a watch for its atmosphere and a few standout scenes, but don't go in expecting a cohesive and groundbreaking experience.With better scripts and a more refined approach, the cast and crew have the potential to deliver more compelling films in the future.",

It was really the late-'90s/early-2000s ones that I went to see in movie theaters, a lot of them on opening day as they came out. There's definitely a spiritual sort of through-line between those films and ours, but in terms of the way THERE'S SOMEONE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE looks, I was just excited to be able to take a more classical approach to styling a movie. I'd never had the chance, or had the time or the money to be able to craft a film visually in the way we were able to do with this one. I worked a lot with the DP, Jeff Cutter, in terms of thinking about what lenses we were going to use, and what the look was going to be, and it was thrilling to be able to craft the movie in a way that spoke to solving the problems of this individual project, as opposed to feeling like I had to throw in specific visual references to these other films you're talking about.\"",

However, Denise has had enough of the company of her abusive husband, who is always hungry, so she stabs him with a spade, and then suffocates him to death on their balcony. This is how the story starts, but it's not Denise who's the main character: the plot revolves around three younger women Nicole, Ruby and Elise who decide to have a little get-together on Nicole's balcony that evening and they will never stop.This picture is Noémie Merlant's debut as adirector, and she's doing this with a blast. She's not scared to combine all the existing film genres in one: horror, love story, thriller, drama, comedy, etc. But she doesn't seem to care about the genre, what she does care about is to make her message very clear. She says, no, yells, shrieks, screams: a lot of women are daily raped, violated, humiliated, oppressed, and victim-blamed by men, most of whom are their boyfriends, husbands or neighbors. Noémie doesn't want them to get away with it, nor do her grotesque characters, who will find their liberation, and they don't care at what cost.An astonishing, gross, graphic and very confident debut. Bravo Noémie!",

After an incediblty cringy opening scene, the 'evil' Russians invade the country, shoot her husband, and the woman goes on a killing spree to avenge her husband.What follows is a typical 'down by the numbers' gorefest where the female witch protagonist first toys with their heads with all sorts of mindtricks, and then leads them to their deaths. Most of the death are pretty cheesy IMO, so if you're into gory deaths (I'm not) then this might be your cup of tea. There are some atmospheric shots in between from birch forests and some candle lit rooms, but it still has the whole feeling of a corny slasher movie.The movie also seems to have no problems with conveying a political message. The Russians are clearly the bad guys here, looting and r@ping and killings as they see fit.PS: some clarification. The other reviewer said something about the dogs name and Pantera. Actually, the Russian says Bandera, the name of a famous Ukrainian collaborator in WW 2. Just to clear that up.",

People do like each other and sleep with each other, but nothing that can be considered ... well sufficient enough.That all being said, maybe you skip those scenes or fast forward them in the erotic movies anyway, because you find the rest just too funny ... I am guilty of doing that. You don't have to do that here, since the movie concentrates on the story. It's kinda refreshing ... it is also quite fun. The acting is hit and miss ... but if you suspend your disbelief and just go with the flow and just don't mind seeing some beautiful people being silly ... with some nice twists (and some female power behind it all) ... you could do a lot worse.",

            "storyline": "This was the second movie that I watched at Nightmares Film Festival. I got to see the United States premiere of this film. What intrigued me was that at a previous year for this festival, I watched Book of Monsters. It features the same creative team and actors. I thought this might be a sequel of sorts, but this is just using a similar title. Ahead of this, I followed the Instagram page and was excited to check this out.Synopsis: the sole survivor of a blood-drenched massacre must team up with a rag-tag bunch of rookie cops and lawbreakers to defend a police station from an invasion of monsters from another dimension.Here we start in a cabin in the woods. We see the ending of a ritual that results in everyone being killed, except for Jamie (Lyndsey Craine). She cuts her way out of the door with a chainsaw and is then taken into custody. She doesn't realize this at first. After getting cleaned up, she is then interrogated by Dara (Johnny Vivash) and Melvin (Daniel Thrace). They don't believe her story and think that she killed everyone there. She is taken to a holding cell and shares it with Big Jenny (Rebecca-Clare Evans).In these cells, we see her being joined by a bachelorette party. Blair (Fenfen Huang) is the bride. Her maid of honor is Chelsea (Michaela Longden), but they're not getting along. She has a shadow who agrees with everything in Crystal (Louella Gaskell). There is also Ruth (Juné Tiamatakorn) who is vomiting. In another cell is Tinny G (Nicholas Vince). Helping here is Dennis (Arron Dennis). He believes that Jamie is innocent but can't prove it.What we learn later is that Dennis and Melvin are brothers. Together, they go to visit Casey (Yvonne Okyere) who is the lab tech. The 'eldritch blade' artifact that was used in the ritual is brought here and she is analyzing it. Jamie tries telling the cops that they need to stop or it is going to spell their doom. That is what happens when Casey reopens the door and monsters attack this police station. It is another fight for survival for Jamie. Not everything is as it seems though as this place is plunged into another dimension.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that this movie doesn't have the deepest story. It also doesn't need one either. It's built on the practical effects of the monsters. These are on point. I was warned before this started that this goes bloody and gooey, which it doesn't disappoint there. We are even getting heavy Lovecraftian vibes which also had me smiling in the theater.Where I want to start delving a bit more into would be this being a standalone and not a sequel. I'm not going to hold it against the movie by any stretch. How they ended that first one though made me want to see the adventures of Sophie. There are elements that seem like cross-overs though. Something happens at the end that I think is a connection with certain individuals. I did like that. What I will give credit to though is that it allowed Craine to take on a different character, Jamie, develop it and give a good performance.Now that is out the way, let's get over to the best part of the movie in my opinion and it is the Lovecraftian stuff. We are dealing with elder gods and they are considered demons here. We have the eldritch blade that is used to bring these entities forward. Eldritch is part of the Lovecraft mythos. I'm pretty sure I saw a Cthulu sighting in this movie. I'd also say that the monsters that attack in the cabin and holding cells area fits that vibe as well. I'll bring up once more that they did all they could with the practical effects and they look wonderful. Special credit to that. Even the CGI used wasn't bad. It was used for things that just couldn't be done and that's how it should be in my opinion.The last parts of the story is just that I love using this police station in the United Kingdom as our setting. They don't have guns to fight back with, which is interesting to see as an American. I like the fact that they find weapons in the evidence room and things that you'd find in buildings like this as well. There are ritual elements and even a bit of a cult, which are things that I love to see as well.That should be enough there so then over to the acting. No one is great here, but they don't have to be. The characters are played a bit more on the comedic side which can be harder if I'm honest. I love Craine in this role and we see her get to show a bit more of her talents. Jamie has depth and growth which I didn't see coming. Dennis is good as this bigger cop who is a bit bumbling. He plays well off his smaller brother Melvin. I liked Huang, Tiamatakorn, Longden and Gaskell as this bridal party. It feels like they all have known each other for years and that is coming to a head on this night. The alcohol they ingested before coming to the station doesn't help. I'll also credit Vivash, Vince, Evans and the rest of the cast for rounding this out for what was needed.All that is left then is the rest of the filmmaking. The cinematography is good. We have that isolated feeling that they can't escape, which is good. That is almost an Evil Dead feel. I've already said what I can about the effects. The soundtrack also works to help build the atmosphere and tension for me. I like the sound design for the creatures as well. That worked.In conclusion, this is another fun movie co-writer/director Sparke. I've enjoyed both monster movies I've seen from him. He and I have similar taste in films from what he said at the Q and A. He wears his inspirations on his sleeves in the best way possible. This has enough of a story to get me invested and the effects take over from there. The creature designs are great. The ritual, cult and Lovecraftian stuff is on point. The acting helps bring characters to life and I think that this is done well enough. No glaring issues there outside of it just having a lower budget. It can stretch it though. I'd recommend this if you're into movies like this as it feels like a more whimsical The Void.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",

The response from fans was negative, criticizing the lack of violence and gore seen in Craven's previous films. The studio eventually discovered Craven's popularity as a horror film director. The president of Warner Bros. at the time, Mark Canton, demanded Rubin write six additional gore scenes into his script, each bloodier than the last. Rubin worked very hard with Craven to create a very deep and heartfelt movie out of it. Unfortunately, added gore scenes, re-shoots and post production re-editing of the movie heavily changed the original story. Craven and Rubin expressed strong anger at the studio and thus disowned the film.",

In the morning, he changed the title to \"Terror Train\", wrote up 22 pages, and made a deal on it with Sandy Howard's company at 3:00 in the afternoon.",

During this time, several murders of women were committed by Ball, and the legend is that he would dispose of his victims' bodies by feeding them to his pet alligators, but it was never proven that the flesh found in the pit was human.

From the titillation to the violence to the revenge, it's all here. And that's exactly what I wanted to see. At 135 minutes, every act of the movie has enough room to breathe and never feels rushed.Although there may be a few odd plot holes (like is Sabel with a wig so unrecognizable? Surely her tattoos should have given the game away), these can be easily overlooked.Overall, if you're a fan of the sub-genre and are tired of rewatching the classics, Sabel Is Still Young is a worthy successor.",

While Mrs. Moss is waiting for the elevator, she drops a magazine called \"Killer Man\", with a cover design featuring the typical figure, immediately recognizable to giallo aficionados , of a shadowy silhouette, dressed in a fedora and raincoat, gloves, and, of course, carrying a knife. Though the covers are no longer yellow, little old lady Moss is a big fan of murder mysteries, \"gialli\" (plural) in Italian.",

It was released in the European market, however Stanley has never seen this version. Stanley came to an agreement with the producers over a 95-minute compromise cut. At this point the film's British backers, Palace Pictures, went bust, making it increasingly unlikely that the film would ever see the light of day in a UK cinema. Then after about a year of frantic searching, Stanley discovered that the original negative was being held by PolyGram. He went to the film's original investors, Channel 4 and British Screen Finances, which were naturally keen to see what had happened to their investment. PolyGram was obliged to hand over the negative, which Stanley re-cut to his own specifications, and with his own money.",

They've mastered the art of crowd-funding, and as the saying goes, nobody does it better. Their latest project, Devil's Knight, is another hit in their growing catalog of films.Coming hot off last year's Bermuda Island, Devil's Knight, directed by Adam Werth, takes us to medieval times, where monsters roam the land. The settings in this movie are elaborate and authentic, showing that the Mahals spared no expense in making their biggest production to date.The movie opens with a group of trackers on a mission to kill a creature, setting the mood with a tense campfire scene that quickly turns into a bloodbath. The lighting and choreography in this sequence are excellent, with splatter effects that horror fans will appreciate. It's a strong start to the movie, promising bloodshed and action that only ramps up from there.In Devil's Knight, the people live in fear of the monsters roaming the countryside. King Samuel (Kevin Hager) of Veroka hires an elite group of global monster hunters, known as the Lost Blades, to hunt and kill the ancient Bone Devil, whose reign of terror threatens the Kingdom of Remény. The Lost Blades are a ruthless, efficient group, and we get a taste of their skills early on. But, as in any good story, there are deeper layers-conspiracy and betrayal lurk behind every corner, and no one can be trusted in the Kingdom of Remény. The plot is rich with intrigue, and the writing by Vincent V. Gelsomino and Adam Werth is tight, giving the audience exactly what they want: monster action and political drama.The Mahals know their audience well and have once again gathered a fantastic cast and crew to bring their vision to life. Tom Devlin's creature designs are terrifying, perhaps his best work yet, and the practical effects are top-notch. Fans of classic sword-and-sorcery films will find much to love here, with beautiful women, heroic knights, magic, beasts, and carnage galore. What sets Devil's Knight apart is the balance of power between good and evil-neither side stands out as predictable, which keeps the audience on their toes.The film's technical aspects are worth noting as well. Vanessa Giacoletti's makeup, Joanna David's costumes, Terence J. Rotolo's stunt coordination, Tyler David Gilbert's score, and Michael Su's stunning cinematography all come together to create an immersive world that's both beautiful and terrifying.Overall, Devil's Knight is another solid entry from the Mahal Empire. They continue to deliver films that please their core audience, and with four more projects in the pipeline-Alien Horde, Cursed Waters, Alien Storm, and Bikers vs. Werewolves-it's clear they have no plans of slowing down. I'm personally excited for what's next. Cheers to another great movie!",

            "storyline": "Although this is the first official directing credit for James Cameron, most of the work was actually performed by Ovidio G. Assonitis, the film's producer and prolific film-maker. Assonitis had made a deal with a small label at Warner Bros. for a budget of $500,000 to produce the movie, provided that an American was credited as director. After considering Miller Drake as director but finding him unsuitable, he gave the job to Cameron after being impressed by his special effects on Galaxy of Terror (1981); but what he really wanted was a first-timer who he could easily side-step in order to take over as director, something he had already done on Beyond the Door (1974) and Madhouse (1981). According to \"Dreaming Aloud,\" a biography of James Cameron by Christopher Heard, and \"The Futurist\" by Rebecca Keegan, Cameron worked on the film's special effects, re-wrote the script, created storyboards, did location scouting and actually filmed for four days. However, Assonitis called most of the shots, continuously questioned Cameron's decisions, did not allow him to watch his own footage, and finally fired him on the fifth day of shooting, reportedly because Cameron's footage wouldn't cut together. Later, Cameron was able to convince Assonitis to show him a rough cut of the film, which was horrible, but not because there was anything wrong with his footage: Assonitis had simply manipulated the situation to re-write half the movie (adding nudity that wasn't in the script originally). Cameron then broke into the editing room every night for weeks, and cut his own version. Unfortunately, Assonitis found out and re-cut it again. The most widely distributed version of the film that is available on DVD is Assonitis' version, although Cameron was later allowed to create a director's cut that saw a limited release in some markets.",

Snake handling was an outgrowth of the Azusa Street revival. In 1910, after reading in Mark 16:18 \"they shall take up serpents... and it shall not hurt them,\" former bootlegger George Went Hensley, aka \"Little George,\" took a rattlesnake box into the pulpit. He reached in and lifted out the venomous viper, showing his faith to take God at his Word. He then challenged his congregation to do the same. News spread throughout the hills of Grasshopper Valley in southeastern Tennessee. Before long, others joined in the handling of rattlers. The practice continued for ten years until one of the faithful died of a snakebite. Hensley moved to Harlan, Kentucky.",

Moreover, camera bulbs got smashed and the crew raced to cover the camera with a plastic sheet. The storm then subsided and disappeared. But director Mike Newell was advised that such storms can rise-up again for a repeat showering. As Heston calmed the set, and York was helped from the side-lines by Heston's wife Lydia, Newell prepared for another take. York and Heston then blocked their spots, and just as Newell yelled \"Action!\", the storm rose again. As such, the scene got shot with the real life special effects of a real life storm and without any movie manufactured special effects.",

Yup, two minutes into the movie, you've already seen the best this movie has to offer, then nothing else comes close.There were some early scenes that the director may have felt were stylish, but, in retrospect, were more likely added just to pad the movie's runtime. Or, equally plausible, an early draft of the script had elements that were discarded along the way. I won't go into specifics, so as not to include any spoilers, but if you have absolutely nothing better to do and watch this movie, you'll see what I mean.",

A movie with a plot and an ending. The build up was a little bit of a slow burn but once the ball gets rolling it rolls right up until the ending credits.

            "storyline": "I think most people wanted to see a hot girl sword fighting in armor in medieval forests. That's all the poster's fault. As much as I hate formulas, movie posters are not art, they are templates designed to tell the viewer at a glance what kind of film you are giving them. In that regard, the poster was atrocious.Instead you get a slow paced thriller about a young woman traumatized by her mother's suicide when she was a child and the subsequent estrangement of her father. The film brings in a demonic force, but it's nothing more than a symbol of the past one must overcome in order to move forward and not a horror element. The actresses are beautiful and actors (all seven of them, perhaps with the exception of the child, but you know.., child actors) do a good job. The mood is appropriate and the sets well done. The film is rich in psychological symbols and I think for someone living similar (but non supernatural) situations, this could actually be therapeutic.All in all, for the type of movie it is, it's a pretty good movie. I agree that it could have packed more in less time, but sometimes, if you are in the mood, you can get into the atmosphere of a slow burning film and this is exactly that kind of film. If you are impatient to see sweaty chicks grunting while wielding heavy metal swords you will, of course, be disappointed. However, people that would identify with the main characters would actually benefit from the gradual exposure to possible triggers.Another aspect of the film that unfortunately took something from the overall experience was the fight scenes in the dark. You could barely understand what was going on. It's a small point, but also a relevant one.Addressing the lesbian elephant in the room, it was by no means woke, and it wove naturally into the plot. Did the film linger a bit too much on the personal relationships of the lead character so that absolutely nothing really happens in the first 45 minutes? Yes. But that has nothing to do with gender politics.All in all, I think the people that would have enjoyed the film were thrown off by the poster just as the people who would not have enjoyed were lured in by it. It is a good movie that I don't regret seeing, even if it wasn't really entertaining. Good acting and directing.",

Boy I shouldn't have had such high hope.This movie has this problem that Vietnamese movies have always had: a very stiff feel to it.The dialogues feel very unnatural with words and phrases that you will never hear actual people in the region (or almost anyone who does not exist in a book) say. It has such a pace that almost feels like they want to make sure that kids from the age of 5 can ascertain which one is the bad guy; the voice and mouth movements clearly do not match, the footstep noise and the actual footsteps do not match, every time someone takes a puff of the cigarette, hear the burning sound cutting through the air as if the your ears are 2cm from it.It does have some okay jump scares for a typical horror. The problem is, They are the formulaic jump scares with sound effects loud enough to startle you. And unfortunately that is it. Character development feels so shallow that if you took out all the scenes that are only there to scare you or where the camera moves to spend moments on one single supposedly important detail, the movie would be left with probably about 30m runtime.The ending was completely out of place, while the end scene tries to turn it into something else. I doubt that it makes much sense or adds anything to the story but a fleeting and forced sense of seriousness.Maybe I'll wait another 10 years for my next Vietnamese cinematic experience.",

            "storyline": "After the death of his wife, a plant worker moves with his teenage daughter to a derelict mansion in a Muslim-majority suburb of Bangkok where his disrespect of several artifacts inadvertently unleashes a series of curses upon them and must try to make it right to stop the incidents from continuing.Overall, this one has quite a lot going for it. Among the main likable features here is the strong storyline that lets the film work in localized folklore and traditions as a building block for more straightforward supernatural antics. Operating within the confines of the country's history by exploring Thailand's uneasy cultural and social relationship with Malaysian citizens with the Muslim community conflicting mightily with the more traditional Buddhist methodology in place throughout the country is a wonderous way to work with here. Rather than just simply coming upon a series of ghosts or hallucinations and thinking it's all just inside his head, the downward spiral is instead given a historical context that easily explains everything happening to him and his relationship with those around him. When those aspects are brought up as a possible means for the nature of what's going on around him, this setup becomes more believable which helps to bring together the confines of the final half where it all makes sense. In addition, the film gets a lot right with its series of impressive and somewhat chilling hauntings. With the opening setup featuring a small hint of the resulting curse that affects others coming shortly, the gradual build-up of events once the action shifts to the present day is quite intriguing. Featuring the traditional series of setups including hallucinations of people or things that aren't there, shadows coming to life behind their knowledge, or whispers of demonic influence taking hold, these aspects are a major part of the middle segments here as the haunted house-style structure is in place. These lead up to the strong finale where the spectacle is ratcheted up a notch involving the influence of spectral beings, banishment rituals, a supernatural combat session, and a more focused energy that allows for a lot of action to take place at a time when it's warranted and necessary. This section also brings about the big importance of utilizing the Muslim culture for how the demonic beings interact and how the spiritual battles take place which adds a different flavor to these scenes. As a whole, these factors are enough to bring about a lot of fun for this one although there are some issues here that arise. One of the main detriments is a challenging and somewhat unnecessary running time that goes on way longer than it should. While we get plenty of build-up surrounding their strained relationship and the need to rebuild it as well as the inner workings of their being in the community, some of this goes on way too long and causes the pacing to drag and stutter to a halt as a result. Quite a bit of the repetitive nature of the neighbors' trying to instill their beliefs upon the two or welcome them into the community at work is capable of being trimmed, much like the flashback explaining the origins of the cursed property that plays out in a reenactment rather than just being served as a story told explaining what happened. Seeing the past featured as it does with the various figures responsible for cursing and countercursing the location is just exhaustive and draining when just a simple story about it would've made the film go by a little easier. Also, the need to include the secondary backstory involving his depression over his dead wife and the grief associated with that as the reasoning for his easy possession doesn't need to be there as the religious history of the house and surrounding areas was already enough to explain what was going on. Tacking this on feels like overkill at a time when it doesn't need anything extra added to it, and is what ends up holding the film back slightly.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence.",

Franco defended the film and explained it was the style he was going for. Still dissatisfied, Dietrich told Franco it was a terrible film and wasn't sure if he would be able to sell it to theaters. However, much to Dietrich's surprise, he managed to sell it to numerous European cinemas and the film was a decent success at the box office and received several good reviews at the time. Many years later, in an interview, Dietrich thought more highly of the film and said it was the first film to use the Dogme 95 style before Lars von Trier. Franco went on to make 16 more films for Dietrich over a three year period, and he told Dietrich they were the best years of his life.",

The film was originally supposed to begin with Jenny's subplot of the film and the Carter Nix/Cain's subplot was supposed to emerge later in the story. After acquiring a copy of De Palma's screenplay, Gelderblom re-ordered the scenes as originally intended and it was released on the website Indiewire on January 31st, 2012 with positive feedback. Even Brian De Palma himself was very pleased with the results. So much so that when the film was going to be released on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory in 2016, De Palma was able to convince Shout! to hold off on their initial release so the Re-Cut could be included on the Blu-ray. What was just a fan re-cut of the film has now officially become De Palma's Director's Cut. Gelderblom expressed on his website how extremely happy he was.",

While Craven's death put the notion of returning to Hatchet in Green's mind, it was another of his heroes, George A. Romero, specifically telling him to make more Hatchet films for the fans, that solidified his decision to make a fourth Hatchet. Romero passed away just thirty-seven days before the surprise unveiling of this movie on August 22, 2017, and Green stated that this movie would not exist if not for Romero's pep talk assuring him that what he did as a filmmaker mattered, and was needed for the genre. At the London premiere on August 26, 2017, a photo of the moment when Romero had told Green to make another Hatchet film was put up on the screen behind Green. An emotional Green pointed to the sky and dedicated the film to Wes Craven and George A. Romero, who inspired him to ever try and make horror films in the first place. The film itself has a dedication to both filmmakers in the end credits.",

They've rented a place on a small island in a beautiful lake, a lake where there have been scary rumors of an old woman who died there hundreds of years ago.

However, Squitieri's screenplay proved too expensive to shoot so Caminito decided to stop working with him (he nevertheless paid him his full, hefty, salary). Shooting had already been postponed several times and the Italian TV network which co-produced the film was getting nervous. So Caminito hired a third director, B-movie veteran Mario Caiano, and shooting could start. On his first day, Klaus Kinski got into a violent argument with Caiano and refused to work with him. The director then agreed to leave the set (after being paid his full salary), the third director to leave the picture before principal photography was complete. Facing disaster, producer Augusto Caminito then decided to direct the film himself so he wouldn't have to pay another director. Since he had almost no directing experience, he was helped by his assistant Luigi Cozzi. Kinski also reportedly directed some scenes himself.",

I happened to get a chance to watch it, and given my fascination with all things horror, of course I needed no persuasion to do so.The storyline in the movie was slow paced, and it was definitely a different approach to the zombie genre. And on that account \"Cenaze\" was original, points added for that accomplishment. However, I have to say that the narrative was rather sluggish and slow paced, and without much of anything overly interesting happening throughout the course of the movie, it was a tough 109 minutes to sit through.Of course I was not familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie. But I will say that the acting performances were fair, despite the fact that the script failed to entertain me.Visually then \"Cenaze\" was okay. It was not a movie that needed to throw an abundance of special effects in the faces of the audience in order to tell its story. And whatever simplistic effects were in the movie served their purpose well enough.One thing that really annoyed me in \"Cenaze\", aside from the fact that the script was not entertaining, was the constantly twitching and flinching camera work. It was so annoying to have the camera constantly moving about. It wasn't big or fast movement, but still it was enough to irritate me. Why not just secure the camera properly for a more professional presentation of the film? This whole handheld or home-video type of shooting doesn't sit well with me.I do believe that \"Cenaze\" was actually my first time to watch a Turkish movie.This movie, from director Orcun Behram, is not one that will find a wide appeal with the general horror audience, as it is somewhat of a very acquired taste. And it is a movie that you need to have a peculiar interest in entertainment to sit down and find enjoyment in. It was somewhat of a swing and a miss in terms of entertaining me, so this is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time. Nor is it a movie that I will recommend you to rush out and get to watch.My rating of \"Cenaze\" lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",

            "storyline": "In a world where cinematic brilliance often comes from unexpected places, Catnado emerges as the unexpected tour de force, a film that could only be described as an extraordinary achievement in modern filmmaking. Directed by the daring trio Blair Kelly, Curtis Everitt, and Donald Farmer, Catnado is more than just a film; it's an exhilarating experience that sweeps viewers up like a whirlwind - or, more fittingly, like a tornado filled with cats. With the tagline \"It's like Sharknado, but with cats,\" this movie sets a high bar for itself from the start, yet it somehow manages to exceed all expectations. From its jaw-dropping special effects to its nuanced performances, Catnado is a symphonic, cinematic masterpiece and a true testament to the innovative spirit of the 21st century.A Storyline That Pounces on the ImaginationThe plot of Catnado seems deceptively simple at first glance, but as the film unfolds, it reveals a layered and thought-provoking narrative that explores themes of survival, human resilience, and the often-underestimated ferocity of feline fury. The story begins with a peaceful town that suddenly finds itself under siege by a tornado, but this is no ordinary storm. In a twist that feels both inventive and terrifyingly plausible, the tornado is filled with cats. Not just any cats, but cats of all breeds, sizes, and temperaments, each one driven to wreak havoc upon humanity.While the premise could easily have been played for mere laughs, Catnado treats its concept with the seriousness it deserves. The script, full of witty banter and unexpected emotional depth, allows the audience to engage with the characters as they face the surreal yet deadly threat of airborne felines. There's a real sense of urgency as the townspeople scramble to defend themselves, and by the end, viewers find themselves surprisingly invested in the fates of these characters.Special Effects That Redefine the GenreIn a film about a cat-filled tornado, the special effects were bound to be scrutinized. Yet, Catnado is nothing short of revolutionary in this department. The visual effects team, whose work deserves awards and accolades galore, has managed to achieve something few would think possible: rendering a tornado of cats with breathtaking realism and clarity. From the individual fur strands to the glint of mischief in each cat's eye, the attention to detail is staggering. Each frame is carefully crafted to immerse the viewer in a spectacle of feline fury, and the tornado itself is nothing short of awe-inspiring.Rather than relying on cheap CGI, Catnado employs a blend of practical effects and digital wizardry that creates a seamless, almost hypnotic visual experience. In scenes where the cats burst through windows or swirl menacingly above the town, the effects are executed with such finesse that one can hardly tell where reality ends and the special effects begin. The sheer technical prowess on display elevates Catnado beyond its peers, making it a standout in a genre often criticized for subpar effects.Acting That Rivals the ClassicsThe performances in Catnado are nothing short of astonishing. Each actor approaches their role with a level of commitment rarely seen, particularly in a film with such an unconventional premise. The cast, filled with both seasoned actors and newcomers, brings a profound humanity to their roles, grounding the outlandish storyline with performances that feel genuine and heartfelt.In particular, the lead actors deliver standout performances, blending fear, courage, and a touch of humor with remarkable skill. Their portrayals of everyday people grappling with the absurdity and terror of a cat-filled tornado add a layer of believability that's essential to the film's impact. Each look of shock and every gasp of disbelief is played with authenticity, drawing the viewer deeper into the narrative.The cats, of course, are the real stars of the film, and their performances are nothing short of extraordinary. From stealthy prowls to dramatic leaps, the feline actors display a range of expressions and behaviors that bring the tornado to life. The directors' skill in managing these feline stars cannot be understated; each cat seems to embody a unique personality, adding depth to the tornado itself as a character.A Cinematic Symphony of Sight and SoundThe soundtrack of Catnado is as essential to the film's success as the special effects and acting. Every note of the score heightens the tension and enhances the sense of awe, fear, and wonder. The music is masterfully synchronized with the action on screen, creating a sensory experience that sweeps the viewer along with the storm. At moments of high drama, the score crescendos, mimicking the escalating chaos of the cat-filled tornado, while quieter moments allow for a poignant exploration of the characters' emotional journeys.The sound design is equally impressive, capturing the eerie howls of the wind and the unsettling growls and hisses of the cats as they swirl through the air. The blend of natural and unnatural sounds creates an atmosphere that is simultaneously haunting and exhilarating, immersing the viewer in the world of Catnado and enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.A Triumph in FilmmakingWhat makes Catnado truly remarkable is the delicate balance it strikes between humor, horror, and heart. It's easy to laugh at the absurdity of the concept, but the film quickly draws viewers into its world, making them care deeply about the characters and the outcome of the story. The directors handle the material with a light touch, knowing when to play up the comedy and when to let the drama take center stage. The result is a film that feels both hilarious and genuinely moving - a rare combination that speaks to the talent of its creators.In the end, Catnado is more than a mere parody or novelty film. It's a powerful, expertly crafted piece of cinema that transcends its genre. This is a film that delights, terrifies, and surprises in equal measure, leaving viewers with a newfound appreciation for the power of storytelling and the magic of movies. Decades from now, film scholars will undoubtedly look back on Catnado as a landmark achievement, a film that redefined what was possible and dared to challenge the norms of its genre.Catnado is, quite simply, one of the finest films of the past century, a cinematic experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. In a world where excellence in film is often limited to the most serious of subjects, Catnado proves that true greatness can come from the unlikeliest of places - even a tornado filled with cats.",

Honestly, the characters sound like they've all got sticks shoved so far up their rectums they can't bend to sit. This is not how people spoke in the 1850's: it's how the literature sounded, but not the speech. Anyway, the patriarch of this family traveling through the woods believes the spooky, inhuman roar they all hear occasionally is the voice of God. As one does. Before long, pops has lost his reason and is doing some strange things. The only person with an iota of common sense on this little outing is the wife (of course) but little good it does her. Eventually, another character wanders in and blah blah blah. There's bloodshed, craziness, murder, and supernatural hijinks, but somehow it still never gets past being only vaguely interesting, and far from worth the $4 I paid Prime to watch it. The idea could make an interesting movie, but unfortunately this one wasn't it. Pass.",

The dialogue is cringe-inducing, filled with lines that sound like they were randomly generated by a computer program attempting to mimic human conversation. The cinematography is a just a mess, leaving you questioning the director's sanity, and don't get me started on the lighting.Even the soundtrack seems to be actively working against the audience's enjoyment, with jarring choices that make you wish for the sweet release of silence.

I concur with another reviewer that this could have been a passable short if done as a film school project, but as a feature film it fails in every way, completely. And, a shout out to the shill reviewers: Why would you even bother hyping this the way you do? Why not just say that this was, in your opinion, a great effort by up and coming film makers to put together a professional quality film on a shoestring budget. I might not agree, but at least there could be some truth to your review. By attempting to hype this bore-fest as anything more than that you do a disservice to both the viewer and the film makers. Overall, a lousy uncompelling story to start with.",

It seemed like the movie could have potential to be something interesting. It turned out that the keywords here were \"could have\"...\"Harvest Lake\" turned out to be a sleazefest dressed in a horror wrapping. There was so much pointless nudity and focus on sex acts that the movie was almost a softcore porn flick. It was just too much, and director and writer Scott Schirmer could have opted for a much more neutral approach and a more subtle sexual approach, which would have proved for a much more adequate movie.The acting in the movie was good, especially taking into consideration that the acting talents had very little to work with in terms of script and story.The storyline, however, was every bit as mundane as it was generic and predictable. Actually, I will go as far as to claiming that the storylien was sort of pointless, because all that this movie was about was showing sexual depravity instilled upon the minds of the young people by the otherworldly being in the forest.\"Harvest Lake\" had adequate special effects, mind you that there wasn't a lot of special effects. The creature in the forest was sort of interesting, but it was marred by having a very low budget appearance to it. So a few more dollars thrown after the special effects department would have done wonders for the movie.What was the toughest part of the movie to get through was the incredibly slow pace that the storyline was presented in. It just trotted on in a very monotonous pace that really had no ups or downs.I managed to sit through \"Harvest Lake\" to the very end, but I found my focus, attention and interest in the movie hard pressed many times throughout the course of the movie. I was hoping that the movie would pick up and become better as it went along, but that hope was in vain. My rating of \"Harvest Lake\" ends on a generous 3 out of 10 stars.",

The storyline in the movie is bland and there aren't any thrills or excitement to the narrative, and that made it quite a drag to sit through. But I was hoping that the narrative would pick up in pacing and contents, but it just never happened.The acting performances in the movie were fair, despite the fact that the actors and actresses had precious little material to work with. I was only familiar with Mitch Pileggi and Emily Sweet on the cast list.Visually, then I will say that the movie was actually fair. The effects were adequate, though nothing impressive or jaw-dropping.\"Desert Shadows\" was a rather bland horror experience, and it is not a movie that I would recommend you to waste your time, money or effort on. Some of us suffered through this ordeal, so you don't have to; you're quite welcome.I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch \"Desert Shadows\" a second time, as it was hardly capable of sustaining itself the first time around.My rating of writer and director Tyler Bourns's 2022 horror movie \"Desert Shadows\" lands on a generous four out of ten stars.",

            "storyline": "\"Pandamonium\" is a bold entry into the genre of films inspired by Dante's \"Divine Comedy.\" the film ambitiously navigates the realms of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, much like its literary predecessor.The narrative follows protagonist Nathan (Hugo Dillian), an ordinary man thrust into a horrifying journey through the afterlife after a tragic accident.Nathan encounters fellow victims of the accident and their judgements. The film's strongest points lie in its ability to visualize these otherworldly realms with a creative flair from the production team. The depiction of Hell, with its haunting landscapes and tormented souls, is particularly striking, evoking both fear and fascination.However, \"Pandamonium\" is not without its flaws. The film's pacing, for one, suffers significantly due to two major story breaks that delve into backstories. These segments, while informative and very thought provoking, disrupt the flow of the main narrative and detract from the film's momentum.Both breaks explore the backstory of two victims now in the first circle of hell. While both back stories are heartbreaking and thought provoking, making you wonder if these people deserve their eternal punishment, the decision to insert these backstories within the central plotline might have been intended to enrich the characters, but instead, it comes across as jarring due to the length of the stories. A more seamless integration or a different narrative structure could have preserved the film's pacing and maintained my engagement. Although both back stories were fantastically shot and acted especially the second of the two.Despite these interruptions, \"Pandamonium\" manages to maintain a decent level of intrigue and entertainment. The screenplay, skillfully weaves elements of moral questioning and if redemption is possible throughout the narrative. The dialogues, are thoughtfully written, often reflecting the philosophical undertones of the source material. The film raises pertinent questions about the nature of sin, forgiveness, and the possibility of redemption, making it a contemplative experience for the audience.The performances are another highlight of the film. Delivers a compelling portrayal of Nathan, capturing the character's confusion and fear. Athe portrayal of the mother and daughter from the second backstory was extremely compelling and upsetting.In conclusion, \"Pandamonium\" stands as a decent contender in the genre of films inspired by \"The Divine Comedy.\" While the story breaks for backstory disrupt the pacing and could have been better integrated, the film's overall execution remains solid. It offers a thoughtful and visually engaging interpretation of Dante's classic themes. For fans of philosophical fantasy, \"Pandamonium\" is worth a watch, even if it occasionally stumbles along its ambitious path.",

The haunting is documented in M. V. Ingram's 1894 book, \"An Authenticated History of The Famous Bell Witch\". This movie was based on the book by Brent Monahan, \"The Bell Witch: An American Haunting the Famous Bell Witch\". However, the Ingram book has been called into question by researchers, who have noted that it's based on secondhand accounts and that no firsthand accounts to the haunting survive, and records from the time have not supported the story of the haunting. The Ingram book calls on quotes from letters and diaries but those documents no longer exist (if they ever did) and it is impossible to verify if the haunting actually happened or if it was a hoax or an early urban legend. Some researchers have even raised the possibility that the Ingram book was actually a work of fiction now mistakenly believed to be a factual account.",

There's enough in this film that is unique to give it a good rating and enough call back to other films of the same genre that was adapted without being a ripoff. It kept me guessing throughout and everything was delivered in a well thought out manner. My wife's big criticism was she didn't really understand why the main characters were together in the first place but as the film developed, it did make sense to me. No spoiler there, just something to consider if you land on my side or hers. The makeup and acting were really well done. This movie is all about the character's interactions and doesn't rely on jump scares or cgi. A somewhat unique story with a splash of Jewish mysticism. Memorable.",

In the 1980s, Charles Band Productions announced a sequel, tentatively titled \"Laserblast 2,\" about two boy scouts stumbling upon the weapon and terrorizing their hometown. The project was carried over to Band's later studio, Empire Pictures. For years, it was described as in development, partially completed, or fully completed. In the early 1990s, an ad in Variety offered full sale of the film rights, but it's not clear if they were purchased. By the time the film got produced, the original had fallen into obscurity and Empire Pictures had gone bankrupt. The film was reworked to remove the weapon's alien origins, making it a creation of the U.S. military. The end result, Deadly Weapon (1989), was written and directed by Michael Miner, co-creator and writer of the original RoboCop (1987). Band also produced another loose remake, Alien Arsenal, in the 1990s for his Action Xtreme sub-label.",

Some of the name changes were also very questionable like giving the characters American sounding names which honestly took me out of it. The plot is rushed but the movie itself is filled with plenty of filler scenes where the monster is just standing there.

They typically take on the appearance of a beautiful woman in the trees who lures men into secluded forests to kill them and steal their vitality. A woman who returns as a Churel is said to target the male members of her former family first, in order to get revenge.\nWithin Hindu belief, Churels may become into dakinis (flesh eating female demons/ demi gods) and serve the goddess Kali, joining the goddess' routine in feasting on human flesh and blood.",

Among the better features here is the build-up of the general reveal here and what goes on with the cult makes for a great reveal. The initial idea of the death leading him to a support group where he gets into contact with the coven that has everything set up to get their plan started is surprisingly obvious to see coming but still allows for even creepy imagery to set things up nicely. As the gradual reveal about the witches and what they intend to do with him following the exploits of his daughter, this comes about incredibly well in the second half where his corruption at their hands makes everything come together into a far more ominous which not only includes the reveal about their plans but a series of chilling visuals to accomplish everything. It comes together nicely enough to be quite fun and helps give this some great points even though there are some big issues here that bring this one down overall. The main issue with the film is the overreliance on repeating the same tactic where the constant intrusion from the cult takes the form of dreams and nightmares that do the same thing over and over again. The fact that he has the same thing multiple times where the initial appearance of the sequence is thought to be a haunting where the witches are targeting him before being turned into the reveal that it was all a dream which is a fine tactic once or twice but gets repeated multiple times here to the point where it wears out its welcome quite quickly. It never changes tactic either so it easily comes across as something that drains the atmosphere quite easily so that there's a plodding and draining build-up to the whole reveal due to this repetitive action. These factors all manage to give this one a few issues to overcome.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, and Full Nudity.",

Filming was completed in the early part of 1966, but its American release was not until late 1967, and its British one not until the spring of 1968. David Hemmings made this movie before his breakthrough role in Blow-Up (1966), and it is quite possible that the great (and unexpected) popularity of that movie was what finally pushed MGM into releasing this one. Many commented with surprise on the smallness of Hemmings' role - it is likely that his special billing, along with that of Sharon Tate, was an afterthought to disguise the fact that they had supporting parts. Although this movie was supposed to launch Tate, she had, because of its protracted shelf-life, already been seen in Don't Make Waves (1967), which she had made subsequently. That movie has a special \"introducing\" credit for her as a result.",

The main problem I had was that, overall, the anthology was just a bit...dull. Well-made shorts, for the most part, but I found myself taking multiple breaks while watching because, in toto, it just wasn't holding my attention. A couple got my attention for negative reasons -- despite knowing the basic premise of the anthology, I could figure out what they were trying to convey, or even what was happening. One, \"DTF,\" stood out because it was amusing, if a bit predictable. Overall, though, most of them just kinda happened and I just kinda happened to watch, and I finished it with the feeling that I hadn't wasted my time but I also hadn't really felt like it was worth the time either.A couple extra notes. One, I'm a straight male Gen Xer, so that obviously had an impact on my viewing and my review. Two, if you're one of those men who feel like men are being oppressed for some reason, you'll probably just be angry and resentful watching a few of the shorts. Personally I think you should just get over it, accept that the world doesn't revolve around you, and watch this movie with an open mind. But if that's not possible, you should probably skip this movie and watch something that won't upset you. Why upset yourself unnecessarily?",

The terror continues to befall their little daughter who will become a new host for the desired spirit.Thai films do provide an interesting, unique and creative treat. Home for Rent is one of the proofs of films that provide a new experience in watching horror films. Home for Rent does not just provide the story of a secret sect that is disguised in it, but in terms of stories that have an interesting plot in it. This film has a runtime of 2 hours which may only feel the excitement of this film after an hour after. How not, at the beginning of this film the intensity of the film is quite slow in introducing the characters and conflicts in it. Only an hour later, the film experienced an improvement in the story and became the beginning of the climax of this film. Home for Rent presents a plot twist in it with a backward plot to see it from a different perspective. Not long after, a plot twist occurs again in it with a new angle. Which then connects into a clear unity. Even at the end of the film and the climax of the film still presents an unexpected plot. The climactic scene gives a different ending. Shocking, moving, unexpected and in the end becomes an ending that gives a sense of sincerity in it.Home for Rent provides an interesting and unique mystical horror treat. Appearing different from the story in general, Home for Rent is not only centered on how the sect works, but on a sad drama. Nothing but a sad drama wrapped in a mystical horror story. Home for Rent has a good lineup of actors. They are able to provide stories that make us curious and feel suspenseful. A story plot that plays nicely. The continuous plot twist makes us continue to be surprised and not expect. Overall, the movie is good.",

What was there from the start: a concept ... the main character and his issues and point of view ... the viewer is treated as partner to the filmmakers ... they give you something and you are able to make up your own mind ... what happened and how did it happen?

No woman ever while drinking with a friend has had a pillow fight in shorts and talked about how amazing Halle Berry was for topless scenes. Like what?Also they clearly made.use of that Dolly camera. It was just very obvious watching that this was a brand new director. The sound was off in scenes and the lighting was bad in others and the editing left me confused as hell at times. Can also see the camera man in several shots. The edit should of taken longer. Feel like it was rushed.Ms Johnson was actually interesting.

But the director thought of this little movie to do. I really wanted to like this more by the way ... but I think I am being way too fair with my rating as it is ... the idea is fun, I reckon and the characters have their moments.But it can't really decide where to focus on ... Wrestling (some of the actors seem to have learned more or knew more than the others) or the horror of it all. The humor is hit and misses .. and even something I really loved (a Betamax versus VHS joke) probably will go over the head of most of those watching this ... we also get to see a bit of Chris Jericho and Steven Ogg ... and some other actors you may be aware of.There is charm, there is humor ... but there is something missing ... the X factor ... that even the matches and the effects cannot really save (or put on top ... 1 ... 2 ... 3 and all that)",

A made-in-Japan zombie virus lands on Thai shores during World War II, so the Japanese and Thai army have to contain the threat and keep it under cover at any cost. There is enough war action and some interesting set pieces (tropical beach, jungle, cave etc.), plus good portions of blood and gore, which was a nice surprise. However, as usual with Thai movies, a lot of unnecessary melodrama kicks in and it's made worse from the fact that the zombie ghouls...speak and weep for their families and loved ones... As a result, it's not as good as the previous Thai zombie film I'd seen (The Black Death from 2015), but it still has some interesting zombie mayhem moments to offer. As an extra note, the director started as part of the 'Ronin Team', responsible for the black magic horror classics Art Of The Devil 2&3, so he shows a taste for blood and gore in this offering as well. And it's not a zomedy, which is a good thing.",

She is a great actress and should be given good roles instead of this crappy film. Also lifetime hyped this film making us believe it would be good. Lifetime doesn't promote good movies at all.Unpopular opinion: Try watching movies on lifetime that aren't promoted by lifetime.

Among the better features here is the strong and overall enjoyable setup that allows for this one to stay on a solid enough note. The initial history of the band's backstory involving the personal tragedy, the different idiosyncrasies about how they perform and write music, and the struggle with trying to get the band back on track after a series of setbacks offers a fine enough motivation for taking the offer to shoot the video. This gets them out to the house which is a moody, atmospheric piece that is the perfect type of setting for something like this to happen based on these initial early beats all set out by the strong starting point. Even once they're there, the atmosphere and strangeness of what's going on make for some intriguing ideas as for how things play out here with the way the shoot goes on. However, once the starting point has been established, almost nothing of any interest happens for long stretches of the film. Featuring no shortage of scenes involving the group going through the motions of deciding what they're doing, how they're interacting when they arrive at the house, or the series of personal inflections coming to pass while they prepare for the shoot to the point that it's just bland and dull waiting for things to happen. When it does start happening, the idea of what's going on with taking out the band one by one under the pretense of shooting the scenes for the video but turning into gruesome torture sequences that showcase more stupidity than anything in letting everything get to the point it odes before they catch onto the plan since it's so obvious there's no real surprise at all. It does undermine this just enough to hold this don overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and drug use.",

A tale of jealousy and family demons, at times literally, is what follows.

Some fun and at times clever camera work and strong performances, especially by Sarah Barholomew, drive the movie and show that everybody involved has a lot of potential down the road. There are moments that are genuinely creepy, particularly a haunting hallucination involving one character witnessing varying versions of her own spiraling sanity. The downside is that the movie becomes more and more repetitive as it continues, and it breaks many a rule that is a no no to break in a found footage flick, particularly with its use of music. It also feels like a watered down version of Hereditary set in the found footage genre, but not being done as well it fails to live up to its obvious inspiration or provide anything unique to that story outside of the yoga setting. Mind Body Spirit has potential and is even worth a watch, but don't go in expecting anything above average which believe it or not is a compliment for this horror sub-genre.",

It is also similar to The Usual Suspects (1995), where the line is, \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing man that he didn't exist\". In fact, that idea goes back to Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867): \"La plus belle des ruses du Diable est de vous persuader qu'il n'existe pas!\" (English: \"The finest trick of the devil is to persuade you that he does not exist.\"",

            "storyline": "Mystère is kind of what James Bond would be like if it were made by a sleazy Italian cast and crew. The film just about qualifies as a Giallo, although the spy elements are far more prominent in the plot. Mystère was released in 1983, well after the Giallo heyday, so I'm thinking that writer-director Carlo Vanzina (who went on to direct the more Giallo-like Nothing Underneath two years later) wanted to inject some new life into the genre, and he's almost succeeded in doing that. It's true that Mystère is more than a little bit silly, sometimes even bordering on out and out ridiculousness; but it makes for fun viewing, and that's the important thing. The story is conveyed episodically, and the prologue shows a German photographer accidentally snapping off shots of a political killing. He also gets a shot of the murderer, and before long Russian spies decide that they want the negatives. The photographer hides them in a lighter and proceeds to hire prostitutes Pamela and Mystère, one of which is light-fingered. Pamela and the photographer are killed by an unknown assailant, and Mystère ends up with the lighter in her possession.The film doesn't live up to other genre films in terms of gore; despite the fact that the murders are committed by a man carrying a cane with a blade on the end, we get to see very little blood and the only fairly nasty sequence in the film isn't a murder. There's a few car chases and clever spy stuff thrown in, however, and while this may not necessarily be what a Giallo fan wants; it is fairly entertaining, and at times provides a nice diversion from the common murder-fuelled Giallo plot lines. One of the things that stands out most about this film is Carole Bouquet - the lead actress provides an interesting lead performance, and she's backed up by cult regular John Steiner, who despite being British plays a Russian agent and Phil Coccioletti, who is actually American despite his Italian-sounding name. The music is fairly catchy, but doesn't really provide much in the way of atmosphere. Carlo Vanzina's cinematography isn't particularly stunning either, but it's not too important since this is more of a spy thriller anyway. Overall, this is an interesting film at least; and while I can certainly understand why it hasn't been remembered along with the best of the genre, I'd say it's just about worth tracking down.",

The casting of Marina Hedman, then Italy's most famous porn star, was telling, as was the presence of Alfonso Gaita, a regular of early Italian hardcore. Also non adult actors as Aldo Sambrell and Mariangela Giordano, were asked to do some explicit scenes.\nSambrell was involved in a unsimulated sex scene with Hedman, which he later recalled: \"We had to shoot a love scene, Marina and I... Well, I was lying on the bed, waiting for her, and when she showed up we started making out; after a while I realized that she was doing it for real and I had to stop her and call Crisanti, the producer, because I could not work that way.\" Sambrell was replaced by Alfonso Gaita for the explicit close-ups.\nEven Giordano has explicit scenes. \"Remaking Malabimba was a stupid move. I didn't want to do the sex scenes. I felt used, abused and exploited,\" she commented about this film which marked not only the end of the artistic collaboration with her then-partner Crisanti, but of her personal relationship with him as well.",

Mari Shirato delivers one of the finest performances ever as the woman who will not rest until vengeance is done. She, literally, becomes a force of nature, and her climactic massacre scene has a rawness and cinematic purity to it that has never been equaled. As her fury rages, so does the weather, and it is as if she has become part of the storm that washes the bloodshed away.Ikeda stages much of the action in uninterrupted shots that elevate the film's realism.Also stunning is the score.In the 60's and 70's Japanese filmmakers created the \"pearl diver\" genre, and this uses that lost genre as its starting point.I can not say enough good things about MERMAID LEGEND. It has haunted me for a decade. It is a gift.",

Some of the horses swam ashore, others drowned, and the white mare disappeared. It is recorded that many weeks afterward, the white mare was discovered grazing on the hillside of the island across the channel from Vallejo. From that day, the island was known as \"Mare's Island,\" shortened to Mare Island.",

I was also confused about how the spirit presented itself throughout the movie by appearing as different people. I didn't know the lead was taking medication for what I assume was mental issues while the lead women took medication due to cancer. I will say while the premise is similar the plot isn't.

I saw the trailer before hand and I didn't really want to go watch it. But my wife dragged me and I reluctantly comply. Boy was I entertained. Full marks for all acting and Maykala the little girl stole the thunder. Solid performance all around 👏.While I would have preferred to see more of Satan, she was the devil's child by the way, I suspect some scenes was not included to keep the running time short. I am a fan of slasher gore films like Friday 13th and Elm Street and this movie lived up to my expectations.So kudos to the director 👏 and producers I really enjoyed this one.One final note, this film just lack cinematic artistic shot... such as drone establishing scenes, close ups of feets and faces. And too much music where silence is much preferred.MORE please what is next??",

It is almost as if the film-makers aren't horror fans at all.Story-wise, from the get go it was a bit too obvious, with the nosey ladies bickering over widowhood. Lela being tasked with cleaning the corpse completely unaided also does not reflect the reality of a typical Southeast Asian village-what happened to fardhu kifayah and gotong-royong? There's always that one monosyllabic, antisocial guy/gal to inject a feeling of mystery, and I'm really really tired of seeing this.The only fresh element is how the evil spirits were portrayed to seem unfazed by the quranic verses and loud chanting of the mourners; a trope more commonly seen in western horror films. I imagine this would create some form of controversy among the more conservative audiences in places like Malaysia.At least Indonesia is moving away from softcore porno in their horror films.Another disappointment, unfortunately.",

But with it being a South Korean horror movie, of course I needed no persuasion, as I am a big fan of both Asian cinema and horror cinema. So it really didn't matter that I had never heard about the movie, and thus didn't know what I was in for.Writers Yeon Sang-Ho and Yong-Wan Kim put together a script that sort of fell short of entertaining me. I have to admit that since I didn't understand the whole thing with the infection or curse and the crumbling corpses, then the movie just made little sense. And that made sitting through nearly two hours of this quite an ordeal.The acting performances in the movie were good, and the actors and actresses on the cast list definitely helped to make the movie all the more watchable.Ultimately, then \"Bangbeob: Jaechaui\" was not my cup of tea, and thus I wasn't particularly entertained, and finding it difficult to sit and watch it, having to feign interest in the storyline. But hey, not everything is bound to have an appeal on every viewer, and director Yong-Wan Kim failed to capture my interest here.Visually then the movie was actually adequate. It wasn't a movie that was heavily reliant on special effects. But the CGI effects that were utilized were fair.Now, I am sure that there is an audience out there for a supernatural thriller like \"Bangbeob: Jaechaui\", because it definitely wasn't a horror movie.My rating of \"Bangbeob: Jaechaui\" lands on a generous four out of ten stars.",

And some of the scares of very effective. It takes a little bit to get going but about halfway through the tension really starts building to a very satisfying climax.It's definitely a lower-budget film with a few technical issues throughout but it's an impressive feat for such a micro-budget.If you like films like slow-burn horror with some familial drama this is a nice way to spend an evening.

I love the slow burner horror films and this was definitely one of those types of horror films. Stamm hits on Christian & Babylonian beliefs concerning the origin of the Devil, his demons, and God.  i hate it when people spoil movies so I don't want to tell you whole story.What i did not expect was to REALLY enjoy this film. This is not a jump scare movie There's a small amount of gore that it's't very over the top, but along with the death scenes, they prove to be very effective. But the suspense of Magi was fantastic and its weird but You believe the story. yes,really It'll give you something to think about and it'll make you believe that perhaps, demons DO exist. The rest of the movie was very very fresh and new. There were enough turns and twists to keep you going and a nice amount of creepiness. It's the type of horror that gets under your skin and chills your blood. One of the best films, horror or not ,in recent memory.before seeing this movie you should know What is the difference between angels, Jinns and devils? The JINN are beings living on earth in a world parallel to mankind.They are physically invisible from man as their description suggests. Through their powers of flying and invisibility, the JINNS are the chief component in occult activities. Therefore, Voodoo, Black magic, Witchcraft and Mediums can all be explained through the world of the JINNS. Likewise, so can the illusions and feats of magicians. so think about these words; Magic & Magi...! It was a clever plot with plenty of suspense and I never would've guessed the ending, which was great, surprising and memorable! It stays on your mind for days after.  I recommend this to those who are into supernatural horror with a demonic possession backdrop. Magi is certainly worth seeing if you are a fan of the genre.",

The prologue explains that 3000 years ago a simian civilization of super-intelligent apes struggled with man to gain control of the planet. In the end, man conquered ape after a brutal battle that saw him destroy the ape, his culture and society. After this battle man tortured and killed all the ape prisoners by piercing their eyes with red-hot pokers. One of the prisoners, who was also the leader of the apes, vowed they would return from the dead to avenge man's brutality\" at a point in time before man destroyed Earth himself.

At first, she was only going to be topless, but the day of shooting, Les and director Norman Warren told her it would be better if she were fully nude to give them more options for framing the shot. Moira agreed, but she told Les she wasn't happy about it. Though they had a closed set, she said later it was very embarrassing having to strip all her clothes off and lie on the ritual table stark naked surrounded by male extras and crew for hours while they filmed. To make matters worse, the extras were all wearing masks so she kept imagining all of them were leering at her breasts and vagina. Her breasts and pubic hair then ended up prominently displayed on screen while another nude actress rubbed her hands all over Moira's body. She joked years later that she can't imagine any other producer ever went as far as she did to help a film. She also said she now had more respect for actresses who performed nude because it was tough to do.",

I was excited to see these two and what they'd bring to the table here.VerdictI'll be honest when I looked at the cast list I was quite surprised to see Annalise Basso, she's an actress I always thought was on the rise and yet this suggests perhaps I was mistaken and she's rather gone the route of AnnaSophia Robb.A Creature Was Stirring immediately hits you with fantastic style, a claustrophobic feel, great tension and solid performances. It then adds two additional characters who despite being bland are unable to bring the quality down, then it gradually all begins to go terribly wrong.It delves into the usual tropes and cliches, some writing decisions become rather head scratching, the religious rhetoric becomes tiresome and then it hits you with a frantic finale with another trope and one that I'm so very very very very stupidly sick of. It's seems like an \"Out\" for writers when they don't have any ideas how to end the thing and it has the habit of outright killing the entire film.Had they come up with a better finale this could have actually been an unexpectedly great film, alas it didn't.RantsIf you don't have the budget to create a monster, don't do a monster movie. It's that simple! I'm all for the logic of keeping it in the shadows to save money but even that needs to be done correctly, look at Alien and Aliens for example! Here they do a combination of keeping it in the shadows in a poor manner and trying to present it but making it looking decidedly awful in the process. If you don't have the money to pull something off, don't try.The GoodAnnalise Basso and Chrissy Metz\nBrilliant style\nSome decent ideasThe BadScout Taylor-Compton and Connor Paolo were mediocre\nFalls apart the further in it goes\nPoor finale.",

The Arrow Blu-ray features both the original 80-minute cut and the 97-minute cut, as well as a fan-made composite of the two.",

Later, however, the decision was made to film it as a regular horror film with the less erotic title \"Count Yorga, Vampire\" . This name change explains the poor animation of the name \"Count Yorga\" in the film's title as it now appears on-screen. The original title and original Iorga spelling were both restored to the film by the 1990s, but all prints of it were still identical to the original 1970 release. Apparently, no additional footage survives from its original porn version of it at all and it is unknown if said version was actually filmed or, if it was filmed, whether or not it was finished or even released if it was (it is worth noting, however, that the characters often pronounce the Count's name within the film as \"Iorga\" (ee-yor-ga) and not as \"Yorga\" (yor-ga)).",

Subtle, dark-fantasy cyberpunk, maybe).I don't usually watch horror movies, but I found this movie highly enjoyable because it presented an atmospheric, artistic and motif-heavy exploration of the horrors of living in a soulless metropolis full of lost people, without resorting to jump scares and chases scenes. If you want \"I'm scared to turn out the lights after watching this\" type J-Horror, this ain't it. If you want a thoughtful meditation on the kind of casual cruelty and isolation that can characterize modern life in a mega-city, seen through a rich and immersive horror-type-lens that elevates the mundane and mixes it with the mythic, this is the movie for you.Effigy is, on the surface, a simple story about a woman's gradual mental/moral spiraling. Much of the runtime is spent on atmospheric thematic development rather than detailed or dramatic plot points. The slow-burn is kept from being boring, however, both through the immersive visuals and sound, and, even more so, through the layering of symbols, analogies, motifs, and myths on top of the base storyline.Imagine a dark version of \"Drive My Car,\" but instead of 3-hours of pretentious monotone reading of Chekhov lines that are hard to understand out of context, it layers in an easily accessible Hans Christian Andersen-type haunting fairy-tale on top of the main story. This, combined with repeating visual motifs, ties things together and creates a feeling of inevitability-the protagonists mental and moral decay feels tied to the physical and social decay of the world around her. I would compare it a little bit to AMC's \"The Killing,\" or \"Bird Box Barcelona,\" - a focus on the decaying fringes of a cyberpunk-metropolis, mixed with a heavy dose of poetic and mythic imagery and symbols.This is a movie about, to some extent, the struggle for meaning amidst an uncaring world, and this struggle operates on multiple levels, from mythic fairy tale to gritty undercity drama. The greatest impact of this movie is in its seamless mixing of all of these levels together.For a relatively low-budget independent film, the quality is extremely high, the writing and acting is enjoyable and believable, the visuals are somehow both immersive and claustrophobic, the sound and music rival any big-budget Hollywood movie in terms of quality, and the concept is unique, creative, and memorable.There is not a huge amount of plot, the pace is a little slow at times, and the budget constraints shows in some of the CGI sequences, but the expertly crafted use of motifs and layered stories, combined with the immersive atmosphere make it an enjoyable and memorable film if you are up for the sort of immersive suspense that is horrific, but not shocking, artistic, but not pretentious, and low-budget, but not low-quality.",

            "storyline": "Sure, I can help with that. Here's a 600-word review of why you liked the horror movie:---I recently watched Bogieville which left a lasting impression on me, and I'd like to share why it resonated so deeply. The film masterfully combined elements of suspense, psychological thrills, and classic horror tropes, creating an experience that was both terrifying and intellectually stimulating.First and foremost, the plot was exceptionally well-crafted. Unlike many horror movies that rely heavily on jump scares and gore, this film took the time to build a compelling narrative. The story was layered with intricate details and subplots that kept me engaged from start to finish. The pacing was perfect, gradually increasing the tension and fear without ever feeling rushed or forced. Each scene was meticulously designed to add to the overall atmosphere of dread, making the eventual climax all the more impactful.The characters were another standout aspect of the movie. Often in horror films, characters can feel one-dimensional or clichéd, but that wasn't the case here. The protagonists were well-developed, with backstories and motivations that made their actions and reactions believable. I found myself genuinely caring about their fates, which only heightened the suspense. The antagonist, too, was a fascinating and terrifying presence. Rather than being a mindless monster, the villain had a complex and disturbing personality that made them all the more frightening.The cinematography and visual effects were also top-notch. The use of lighting and shadows was particularly effective in creating a sense of unease. Many scenes were shot in dimly lit environments, with just enough light to make out the horrors lurking in the background. This technique kept me on the edge of my seat, constantly scanning the screen for any signs of danger. The special effects were used sparingly but to great effect, enhancing the realism of the supernatural elements without overshadowing the story.Sound design played a crucial role in the film's success as well. The soundtrack was hauntingly beautiful, with eerie melodies and unsettling soundscapes that perfectly complemented the visuals. The use of silence was equally powerful, with many scenes relying on the absence of sound to build tension. Every creak, whisper, and footstep was amplified, making the quiet moments just as terrifying as the loud ones.Another reason I enjoyed this movie was its exploration of deeper themes. Beyond the scares and shocks, the film delved into psychological and existential questions that added a layer of depth to the horror. It explored the nature of fear, the impact of past traumas, and the lengths people will go to protect their loved ones. These themes were woven seamlessly into the narrative, enriching the story and giving me plenty to think about long after the credits rolled.The film also paid homage to classic horror movies while bringing something new to the table. There were subtle nods to iconic scenes and tropes from the genre, which felt like a respectful tribute rather than a lazy imitation. At the same time, the movie introduced fresh ideas and innovative scares that set it apart from its predecessors. This blend of old and new made for a unique and satisfying viewing experience.Lastly, the movie's ending was both surprising and satisfying. Without giving too much away, I'll say that it managed to tie up the story's loose ends while leaving room for interpretation. It was the kind of ending that stayed with me, prompting me to revisit earlier scenes and reconsider their significance. This open-ended conclusion felt true to the film's overall tone and themes, providing a fitting end to a memorable journey.In conclusion, this horror movie stood out to me for its well-crafted plot, compelling characters, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking themes. It was a perfect blend of suspense, psychological intrigue, and classic horror elements, making it a film that I thoroughly enjoyed and would highly recommend to any fan of the genre.",

Screenwriter Harry Kirkpatrick, also known as James Justice, was given the job of directing, and received sole directorial credit, though he convinced Lenzi to remain on the set in an uncredited advisory capacity throughout the entire production. For years, many horror film fans thought Harry Kirkpatrick was an alias for Lenzi, but Lenzi has stated in interviews that there really was a Harry Kirkpatrick who wrote & co-directed that film. He explained, \"My contribution consisted solely of providing technical assistance. Nightmare Beach (1989) should be considered the work of Harry Kirkpatrick.\"",

Director Denny Harris turned to screenwriters Jim Wheat and Ken Wheat to help improve the story, but they had the radical idea to reshoot the bulk of the film. The actors and actresses who played the college students were brought back for reshoots in March 1978. Yvonne De Carlo, Barbara Steele, Cameron Mitchell, and Avery Schreiber were all brought in during reshoots for name-recognition value, replacing the actors who originally played their roles. In the end, only 12 minutes of footage from the original version was retained in the final finished film.",

It's an easy watch with all the things Spanish horror lovers love - supernatural elements, blood, seemingly endearing characters, nudity, a little more blood, an affair, quick zoom edits, creepy repetitive music, but the coup de gras for me was the wink and a nod to Amor's catalogue at the very end a la \"abuela,\" referencing a character but also the just a few years ago movie she was is which has nothing to do with this movie. Moving on.In short, Amor possesses the young believable ingenue just as Jamie Lee did 40 some odd years ago, and while at least in this interation she doesn't qualify as a \"scream queen\" proper, her ability to distill her character and keep the wee plot afloat makes it all worth it.",

While the facts of the crime were gruesome, the difficulty German prosecuters had in actually charging Mr. Meiwes with ANY crime was the truly shocking part of the tale. Because the two men had met in an and internet chatroom devoted to Gay cannibal fetishism in which Mr, Brandes had clearly expressed his desire to be killed and eaten, Mr. Meiwes was shielded from murder charges under laws that were originally enacted to protect doctors who assist terminally-ill patients commit suicide. At the time, cannibalism was not explicitly forbade in any statute, and it was unclear whether a crime had even been committed under existing German law, a situation that many both in Germany and abroad found absurd and macabre. These real-life events also inspired the song \"Mein Teil\" by the German Industrial band Rammstein.",

Seeing a financial opportunity there, William Burke suggested to his landlord, William Hare, that they sell the body of a recently deceased boarder to Dr. Robert Knox, an instructor at a Surgeon's Square anatomy school. Knox was grateful to have a specimen for his class and Burke and Hare began a lucrative operation that quickly moved from grave-robbing to murder. They killed their victims by suffocating or \"burking\" them. Estimates were that they murdered up to 28 people, preying on drunks, prostitutes, and the destitute elderly.",

It feels like there was no scenario, everything happens chaotically. Evidences are coming one by one and in large quantities, explaining that what is happening, can be just anything. You will try to came up with assumption of what is going on, trough entire movie. And then it ends, leaving you there siting without any question answered. Camera that flicks before something odd is going to happen just spoils everything. The acting is not the good, but it is bearable, and I liked that X-files tribute cameo.",

As a quirky drama it's fine, and the goofy Father Black is worthy of his own film, but as it is AGNES is a case of either false advertising, or perhaps was packaged as a horror film as the distributor had no idea how to label it.For nun/exorcism completists only.",

            "storyline": "This movie kicked off the night portion of Friday for Nightmares Film Festival. I got to see this for its World premiere, which was exciting. The writer/director was also in attendance, which was a treat since we got to learn a bit more about the behind-the-scenes. Looking at the title, I was hoping this would be a Christmas horror movie of sorts. It is that for sure.Synopsis: after suffering a brutal attack on Christmas eve, a young woman struggles to convince her friends that the assailant was none other than ole' Kris Kringle. When Santa returns to terrorize the group in their remote cabin the next Christmas, Nikki (Kaya Coleman) and her friends must overcome disbelief as they fight to stay alive.We start this off on what I believe is Christmas eve. Nikki is getting things ready as she has a friend coming over. We see text messages from her boyfriend, Nathan (Trey Anderson), that is both cute as well as a bit inappropriate. I also believe that she is waiting on her friend, Jess (Scarlett Sperduto) to show up. Things take a turn though. We see feet appear in the fireplace. Santa Claus is here and he attacks Nikki.She then wakes up in the hospital. What she doesn't realize though is that she's been in a coma for a year. They weren't sure that she was going to wake up. The doctor, Dana Millican, wants her to stay a couple of days due to everything that she went through before her coma. She declines and wants to get out.Things are off and she can't fully put her finger on why. Part of the reason is that everyone thinks she tried to kill herself. She denies that, but she's afraid to tell what happened, for fear that they'll think she is crazy. She reaches out to Jess and Nathan to see if they want to celebrate Christmas with her. She learns that they're going to a cabin of their friend, MJ (Cissy Ly). Nikki convinces them to allow her to come.This isn't the ideal time that she was expecting. Jess and Nathan are hiding a secret. Nikki also reveals to the group what happened to her. MJ seems to humor her where the others can't believe it. They point out the fact that Santa isn't real. Nikki brings up different lore from around the world including how dark Nordic countries look at this lore or the fact that Santa works with Krampus. The truth might be closer to what Nikki said than they realize when strange things start happening as a snowstorm rolls in.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that the premise is an interesting one. Seeing the title, I chuckled. There is a bit of humor here, but this is played straight. What works here is the set up where Nikki is attacked. I found it intriguing to then put her into a coma and have her wake up a year later. That is a creative way to get us to the next holiday season. It also allows certain things in her friend group to happen as well.Now that I've set that up, let me delve more into the character of Nikki. Something that I think is a bit of a misstep is that we don't get more of a baseline of her before the coma. We get to see her in that first sequence, but I'm not sure that was enough to set up her. I do think that Coleman plays this role well after she wakes up. It would be tough. The last things she remembers are from the previous Christmas season. It would hard to handle the changes that went down because of this. She is also convinced that Santa is after her, because again, everything that happened was just like yesterday for her. I do like playing with her sanity here with the crash course of events.Where I'll shift then next would be the character of Santa. I won't give away if this is stating he is real or if this is someone stalking them. The reveal was something that I guessed, but it worked for me. I thought that it fit the story that was being presented. It also has a solid stinger ending that I enjoyed. The different lore that gets referenced is also good. What I find interesting here is that this almost is looking at religion vs. Pagan beliefs. This is something I'm a fan of since I'm an atheist and love looking at mythology, whether it is ancient or current Christian mythos. I don't know if this amounts to much though in the grand scheme of the story. What it does though is give Nikki more of an argument when trying to convince her friends.That should be enough for the story as this isn't the deepest there. This is a slasher film at the heart of what we're doing here. What comes with that is that I didn't love the pacing. I do think this is deliberate like most in the subgenre are. That's not to say it is boring though. It just takes time to get into it after the opening sequence. I do think that the cinematography was good. I learned that this was filmed when it was snowing at times and it felt cold. That captures the Christmas vibe. I thought the effects we got for the kills was solid. I'm always a fan there. You may also know that this is one of the things I need for a good slasher. This one is more subdued in this department. Not a bad thing necessarily, but I also can't give it high marks there. I also thought the soundtrack fit for what was needed.All that is left then would be the acting. I thought the cast worked for a low budget slasher. I've already said that I wished they did more with setting the baseline for Coleman. She was solid still as her world was turned upside down. I thought that Sperduto and Anderson were also fine. They aren't subtle in the secret they're hiding. Both worked for their characters. Ly as also interesting. She seems like she might flip-flop on her stances. She helped to make the time at the isolated cabin more interesting. Other than that, the rest of the cast was fine for what was needed. Credit to whomever was in the Santa costume as well. What I like here is that whoever is behind everything was in so props there.In conclusion, if you know me then you know that I'm not the biggest slasher fan. I do think that this is a solid Christmas slasher. We have the mystery of whether Santa is real or not, which adds a wrinkle here. We also have Nikki might be going crazy which makes her a suspect, but it also could be someone playing on that. I do appreciate that element, even though it is one we've seen before. This is made well enough. I think the cinematography is the bright spot there, but the effects were also solid. If you like slasher films, especially the holiday-based ones, give this a watch. I don't think this is the strongest there, but worth a viewing, nonetheless.My Rating: 6 out of 10.",

I think the only thing that has changed recently in trash filmmaking is that now anyone can get a drone shot.As the story unfolded, I was surprised at how quickly the first act was paced. It did not seem like the standard slasher formula was being used; things progressed much more quickly than typical. It still wasn't very good, but it wasn't the same old/same old. I guess it's really hard to edit a scene to play out with any kind of natural rhythm when you work in low budget filmmaking, because these movies always have odd timing to everything; it's no different with Followers. Someone will make a statement or ask a question, and there will be a weird pause with some kind of filler shot before the response comes. None of the actors have any kind of charisma or presence, or if they do, the filmmakers couldn't capture it. Another criticism I have is that I wasn't very interested in the story, and I was especially apathetic to how everything resolved. I am sure I will forget this movie so quickly that the next time I look over my list of reviews, I will have no memory of what this was. Hard pass.",

He wrote the script for the movie, which never got made, but in the process he became friends with Stan Lee. They started socializing and going out for dinner and going to each other's homes. Sometimes we would go out with Bob Kane, the creator of Batman. He had a great time with these guys. When Cohen made this film he said to Stan: \"I think I'm going to make this character a cartoonist who works for Marvel. I asked him to play himself. He was really anxious to do it. It was the only time Stan has had some real scenes to play in a movie and some real dialogue. In the Marvel pictures he's mostly a walk-on or an extra. With me he had a real character to play, even if it was the part of Stan Lee. We maintained our friendship over the years.\"",

This was meant to reduce commercial electricity consumption by moving from a 5-day to 3-day working week and encouraging non-essential businesses to close for 4 days per week. Electricity production was limited due to strike action preventing coal deliveries to power stations and so limiting drain helped prevent total blackouts, although most households and areas across the whole UK did still experience multiple power outages during this period.",

In fact, watching through them allows an old cathedral (which has been torn down over the years, possibly in view of its evil influence) to 'materialize'; at first, he is intrigued by this curious occurrencebut it all turns serious very soon when a shadowy figure he notices within the 'scene' begins to move about and is apparently out to get him!",

They learn the Europeans are going to hunt them for sport. You can try and make out what the film is trying to say here but never quite really gains enough traction. Instead what we get is our the migrants running while being shot at constantly. The movie is difficult to watch with it's content and feels unnecessary.

The initial setup here with the stressful situation of dealing with the friend's death, detailing the funeral, and trying to maintain the semblance of a life she had before the incident provides a clear-cut explanation for her frazzled and closed-off mindset throughout. Wanting to deal with the escalating situation but also not left with any time to do anything herself on top of trying to catch the cat when he escapes their apartment loft which only compounds things further, this type of mental breakdown becomes far more warranted the more this goes on with the exploits of a newfound transformation following the bite as these all come off quite nicely overall. While there's a lot of fun to be had with the upcoming transformation and the generally impressive use of body-horror elements to pull it all off, the fact that it doesn't go for more genuine thrills makes for a difficult watch at times. The series of dreams and hallucinations where the feline instincts and behavior come about after the bite are never treated as though it's threatening to her condition what with the stupidity of failing to see a doctor and get it checked out but it's more treated as a coping mechanism for not being able to move on past her friends' death. That never lets anything happen here so it comes off without any genre material which can lead to some disappointment out there if you're not in the right mood.Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Language.",

It is also quite disturbing, because it never clearly unmasks the killer, not even in the end (but see for yourself and decide for yourself). It's a pity that this unique giallo has been unavailable for some years now (I luckily got an copy of the Italian print which was released in the early 1980's). it will hopefully be picked up sometime by a DVD distributor.

The musical artistry of the cast is second to none. No acting here, just pure performance!Ultimately, the visual wow-factor draws you in (unique setting in France, unbelievable cinematography, glowing landscapes), the casts' performances make you stay, and the themes stay with you long after the movie's over. Beautifully made and thoughtful. Highly recommend.",

It's tiring, it requires a lot of patience and the pay off just isn't there. I get what they were trying to do but...no. It's just not happening with this movie.If you are patient and can stand long periods of tedious camera shots where nothing happens, then this movie is for you. Everyone else will be bored to tears or worse, they'll end up asking, \"What was the point?\" like i did. I think that is the worst thing that can be said about any movie.To the reviewers scoring this movie really high; Stop it.It seems like there are a lot of disingenuous ratings for this movie ( take a look at their one movie review histories), probably by friends and family who think that scoring a movie high is doing these actors a favor.

Before this movie were quoting the Greasy Strangler non stop. Now we quote this. The description is 100% accurate. Its very much like Monty Python meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

This is one of the most over-the-top gory action movies I have ever seen. And I mean, really gory. The director has taken great pleasure in treating the viewer to some sublime inventive kills, to the point you'll be grinning from ear to ear at how ridiculously gory it all is. However, the movie has a lot of problems elsewhere. The acting is far from Oscar worthy. The director's choice of lighting is annoyingly poor at times, with overly bright lights, weird filters, sometimes making the movie look like a poor music video. Also the soundtrack is very hit and miss, with music playing at weird moments, setting the wrong mood, in fact, I'm pretty sure music is playing throughout the whole movie without any breaks. But . . . (and the only reason this is getting 6 out of 10) . . . The movie is saved by the ridiculously over-the-top gory kills, and there are plenty scattered throughout the movie. Just have a few beers before you watch!!\"",

Among the better setups with this one is the series of exploits that go on involving the possession and all of the antics that follow. Featuring a strong setup to bring the group out to the house and why they need to keep filming everything which gives this a great cover for the found-footage format to follow, this one gets rather interesting as things play out involving the priests trying to get a handle on the situation the more they visit her. This leads into the first of several encounters within the house where the exorcism attempt tries to save her which goes through the usual epithet of exorcism films with the priests spouting the usual declarations of faith to God while the possessed writhes around on the bed spouting vulgarities about the hidden truth of the meeting behind everyone. This all comes together to provide quite a lot of fun in the final half when it gets to the released entity stalking them through the darkened house using only the camera for light as there are some genuinely unnerving scenes here involving the supernatural powers it has being put to good use all giving the film a lot to like about it. There are a few issues present with this one. The biggest drawback to the film is the bizarre series of different behaviors exhibited at the start of everything that tries to paint a specific picture of everything going on. The initial scenes of the crew arriving at the house and meeting the antagonistic father and his reactions to everything make little sense as if everything appeared out of nowhere despite repeated claims of being there due to him summoning them, when the situation is broached only leads to snarky comments about the nature of the church. It's all unnatural and confusing enough when this confrontational attitude continually presents itself to the point where it's pretty hard to trust what's going on. That becomes even worse when the series of revelations come about which only enhance that further as this brings about a series of generic and expected setpieces about relationships rather than doing what they set out to do in figuring out the name of the demonic figure possessing her. That's not even brought up once it was presented and instead turns this into a run-of-the-mill exorcism tale despite how much fun these scenes are. These factors are what end up holding this down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",

What's equally clear very quickly is that \"John\" (Brian Vernel) and siblings \"Henry\" (Daniel Portman) and \"Vince\" (Calum Ross) had a masterplan that day that was designed to put their nemesis in the ground. What now occurs fills in, by way of flashback, just what drove these young men to their rather drastic course of action whilst we also discover than pops isn't that easy to do away with. With tensions now mounting amidst the dense Caledonian forest, the brothers start to mistrust each other and with tempers flaring they start to wonder who is trustworthy amongst them. Although the story is different, it reminded me a little bit of \"Mercy Falls\" also from 2023, that over-used the drone footage of ancient woodlands and menacing audio to substitute for some fairly bland writing and acting and a, frankly, increasingly preposterous and protracted storyline that presented us with three principal characters about whom I didn't care at all. It does try to use it's environment to create peril but once the jigsaw (I'd say a six-piece one) of the story was in place then I really did start to lose interest in what became a rather angrily procedural drama devoid of anything at all new or characterful. As a Scot, it's important that we continue to invest in domestic film-making, but endless aerials of fir trees do not, as \"Yoda\" might have said, a decent film make.",

            "storyline": "The alien costume featured here was the same as the one used in another Roger Corman film, Teenage Cave Man (1958). This was done to save money, as Corman and his brother Gene Corman often tried to incorporate existing sets, costumes and other elements from previous films into new ones for financial savings. Screenwriter Martin Varno said the Corman brothers were so conscious of their spending that \"'cheap' was the main word in their vocabulary.\" The monster costume scenes in \"Teenage Caveman\" and this film were shot within about two weeks of each other. The costume was modified slightly for this film. Ross Sturlin wore the costume for the scenes in both \"Teenage Caveman\" and this film. Flming was very difficult for Sturlin because it got extremely hot inside the costume during the exterior shots. John John M. Nickolaus Jr. was director of photography for the film, and Jack Bohrer was the production manager. Daniel Haller, who went on to become a film director himself, worked as art director on this film. He did much of the manual construction work on the set himself, and brought a trailer in to the sound stage so he could sleep there and between work sessions. Among the props he built was the rocket-ship, the frame, which was made of plywood that had been cut into circles, then covered with a plastic sheet and spray-painted to look metallic. Haller also created blood cells that the characters looked at under a microscope, and the baby aliens (which resembled seahorses) they looked at under a fluoroscope. Alexander Laszlo composed the music for the film. Almost the entire crew went on to work on Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) with the Corman brothers and Kowalski.",

Among the better elements with this one is the solid small-town murder mystery that serves as the main setup of the whole feature. The central plotline involving the group of friends coming together at the behest of their returning friend trying to set everything right during the holiday season which serves to set off a series of killings around the town that are directly tied to her arrival makes everything appear quite enjoyable overall. The small-town history involving a history of murders taking place in the town that includes a series of unraveling clues pointing to a figure from it's past come back to life and starting a new spree over everything is all handled nicely enough as the clues lead to a killer directly targeting members of the specific community. Even with this factor being taken into account, the whole setup coming into a rather cohesive conclusion adds nicely to the overall presentation which is a great time here. This one also manages to bring together a fairly solid series of brutal and generally enjoyable stalker set pieces that are handled rather nicely. The opening setup that turns out to be a recreation of one of the stories from the podcast she hosts is an impressive enough time as the case reveal comes off nicely after the stalking and brutal murder that starts everything. The regular stalking here, done at the hands of the Santa-dressed killer, are generally quite fun, resulting in either the sudden shock ambush that ends in a brutal kill or the grim aftermath of everything when they stumble upon everything. With there being a lot to like about it, the only real issue with this one is the generally predictable setup that results from operating in such familiar territory where so much of this one is hammered home by the slasher formula. It's not truly detrimental or damaging but does stand out as a factor against this one.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

I could probably make 10 different versions of this movie that don't even look alike... It took about 3 or 4 years, and trying to get enough money. When you're making an original movie that in the 3rd act, it doesn't go like torture porn or Saw (2004), it goes like Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman, that's NOT a recipe for people wanting to throw money at you. But it was sticking to our guns and I felt like that was what I wanted to do.\"",

Rather than being paid a straight license, Production I.G will receive a percentage of all revenues generated by the film. Through ties to Manga Entertainment, the French company Pathe became the film's co-production company, joining the Hong Kong-based Edko.

There's no rational and sensational explanation of a four-year old kid walking in the house without even screaming and taking everything so natural. Why does not the family move away ? This is another question the scenario-maker needs to answer. Yes the \"haunting\" is about the family not the place, but at least the family needs to try communicating to the soul and solve the problem, instead of hiring a crew to put cameras and take pictures of the house.

I was more interested in pursuing [Andrei] Tarkovsky [Andrei Tarkovsky]'s kind of way of filmmaking where I was making the film for the subconscious rather the conscious. I thought I'd better do something else, so I made The Dollar Bottom (1981)...That won the Academy Award, so that got me The Sender, and it was with Fox, 20th Century Fox, and then right when we were well into it, almost into production, they turned around and cancelled, and Paramount Pictures picked it up in three days, and we went straight ahead. But it's one of these films, I found out, as I said, Paramount were completely not interested in it, they really did nothing with it at the time, which was a shame... it was a very, very good script, and I got a really good cast of actors to do it, and it was a baptism by fire for me, with the producer and the studios and everything...''.",

Bunker has potential but bombs.I thought maybe the slow pace was equal to a slow burn that pays off in the end. This is like watching a bad M. Night Shamalan movie. No pay off and just a plain dumb ending, especially when the monster is revealed. The audience I saw this with laughed at the ending and you just might too when you see what I'm talking about.Disappointing because the setting could have worked. WW1 soldiers hide in bunker behind enemy lines during war. Their lives at stake causes them to duck into the bunker unaware there's something very spooky in their. That's all I'm gonna say in case you're still curious. I'll admit the first act did draw my attention but then after that I got so bored at one point I thought about walking out.

When USA Networks joined the project as production company and distributor, Koontz signed on as screenwriter and executive producer. Martin Scorsese also signed on as executive producer, and a cast (most of whom were in the final product) was assembled. Following creative disputes between USA and Koontz, both Koontz and Scorsese left the project (Scorsese was later convinced to return). Koontz and Anderson later developed the concept into a series of novels (as \"Dean Koontz' Frankenstein\"), but Koontz allowed USA to use the names of his characters as long as they altered the plot and removed his name from all consideration.",

As the parental search for the cure requires more travel, they drop off Luna and Nala with Josefa while they continue their journey alone.We quickly learn that the imperious and demanding Josefa has little patience for the outbursts of Nala. And Josefa's dismissive attitude toward her pre-teen granddaughter, while also dotting endlessly on Luna, bring Josefa and Nala to loggerheads at several points in the film. (Let's just say an iPhone pays a heavy price at a key moment in the film.) With Josefa at her neck, Nala quickly turns to the hired-help, \"Pedro\" and \"Abigail,\" for assistance. With mixed results.What follows is a rather well-done, but also rather conventional, story that feels closer to a Guillermo del Toro offering than Ezban's surprisingly off-beat and wonderfully surreal \"The Incident\" and \"The Similars.\" The sets and lighting in \"Evil Eye\" are top notch, bathed in filtered light and the olive, hunter green, slate gray and yellowed color schemes that have become so familiar in the horror genre for the last twenty years or so. Yet at the heart of \"Evil Eye\" is a familiar folktale or parable: That a request for supernatural intervention in the present will require even greater sacrifices down the road. It was simply Nala's fate to be caught up in a transaction that was undertaken years ago, but now requires the debt to be repaid.Indeed, it is one of Abigail's rural legends involving witchcraft that convince Nala at an early point in the movie that grandma really is a bruja. After enduring Josefa's dismissive and (frankly) cruel behavior, Nala attempts to leave the property with Luna several times, to no avail. Nala is convinced that grandma is literally draining the life out of Luna for her own \"restorative\" benefit. And as time passes, the old woman does indeed disappear into a mass of bandages that make her look less like an old woman than Claude Rains or a plastic surgery graduate. Nonetheless, it is this transformation, increasingly hidden from the viewer, that is the key to the last part of the film.I can't say I was \"let down\" by \"Evil Eye.\" It is a very good movie with a few neat twists, including the ending that I suspect many viewers will see coming before it arrives. But I do think Ezban, confronted with a much larger budget, was playing it very safe here. Despite the narrative frame at the beginning and end of the film, the narrative here is linear in a way that his other offerings to date have not been. And it is that loss of \"quirkiness\" that I perhaps miss the most. If Ezban was a sort of cinematic Jorge Luis Borges up to \"Evil Eye,\" here he really is much more of a del Toro. That's not bad. It's just not what differentiated his work from the rest of the pack.",

            "storyline": "DOCTOR VAMPIRE is your standard campy HK supernatural comedy, but very likeable with a premise that had an east meets west approach on its vampire lore. At times it had me thinking of the Jim Carry starring vehicle \"Once Bitten\", especially the scenes showcasing the doctor's new dress style. The story follows a Hong Kong surgeon, Dr Kueng (a fitting performance by Bowie Lam), who's on a business trip to Scotland and comes by a castle that's a bordello. Unknowingly to him vampires run the show and he falls under the spell of a Chinese lady, Alice (a wonderfully seductive turn by Ellen Chan). She bites him, without his knowing, and he returns back to Hong King where he starts to show signs of vampire characteristics. Where did she bite him, well, let's just say it wasn't on the neck and this leads to some humorous situations in its discovery. His girlfriend begins worrying about him, and the mysterious Alice suddenly turns up on his doorstep to save him from his affliction, and of course from her master the Count.This master looks far from threatening and less so when tries to act it out. His appearance is like something of a 80s pop icon and I was a little unsure if he was meant to be an American or English vampire. Anyway the storytelling is so random with guys being guys, comedy of errors making way for sexual innuendos, relationship woes, mistaken perceptions and snappy banter. This is when the principal character starts showing the signs, acting strange and then when a method of reversing the inflictions is of no use, then coming to terms with what he has become. The gags can be self-knowing and the lowest dominator, yet it naturally flows becoming zanier as it goes along. By the third act when a Taoist shows up on the scene, everything is turned right up as now we get a hopping vampire with a hard-on, blue filtered lighting, oversized needles, a breast shish kebab, a laser battle standoff where the masters shoots red beams from his eyes, floating cranky Buddha statue granting special powers, levitating acrobats and an almighty explosion to finish it off. It's completely daft, but the timing of everything, from its shenanigans to thrills is spot on and the effects are lively with plenty of blood. I guess a hospital is a good place than any to stage it.",

First, it stars Hannah Al Rashid (The Queen of Black Magic, The Night Comes for Us) and Shareefa Daanish (Macabre, Asih, The Night Comes for Us), both of whom are standout actresses in Indonesian horror. Second, it's directed by Billy Christian (Motel Melati). Amanda Rigby, who plays the lead character Anissa, truly stole the show. This was my first time seeing her in a film. I also enjoyed Frisly Herlind's portrayal of Poppy, which added depth to the story.If you're unfamiliar, Wewe Gombel is a vengeful ghost or supernatural entity from Javanese mythology. This film felt like the darker, more adult-oriented Kuntilanak-type story I've been waiting for. The possession scenes were unsettling, and while the creature design was a bit strange, I suspect it was in line with the mythology's traditional depictions. There were a few moments of gore that worked well, and the film did a solid job building tension. It also appears to be setting up a sequel, which I hope comes to fruition as I'd like to see how the story continues to unfold.Overall, Marni: The Story of Wewe Gombel is a well-done supernatural horror. It gets a 7.5/10 from me.",

And I needed absolutely no persuasion to sit down and watch it, as this was apparently some sort of zombie movie that I had never heard about, much less seen before. And since I am a sucker for all things zombie, of course I would check out what director Hank Braxtan had to offer.Writers Hank Braxtan, Steve Hillard, Guy J. Jackson and Dennis Nowlan put together an interesting enough take on the zombie genre. It definitely was a one of a kind take on the zombie genre, I will say that much. But that doesn't necessarily mean it was a great movie. Sure, \"Glowzies\" was watchable and entertaining enough for what it was, but it was hardly a movie that left a lasting impression, much less a movie I will ever return to watch a second time.The acting performances in the movie were good, and had some familiar faces on the screen, with the likes of James Remar and Michael Dorn.\"Glowzies\" actually had surprisingly good special effects. Sure, it wasn't impressive effects that will leave you slack-jawed, but for a movie such as it was, the effects definitely were good.If you enjoy zombie movies, give \"Glowzies\" a chance. It actually is different enough from the mainstream zombie genre to make it worth checking out.My rating of director Hank Braxtan's 2023 movie \"Glowzies\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

That is pretty much the exact feelings you will have when you finish The Black Mass.Not only have we seen Ted Bundy portrayed so many times before that his story is now extremely repetitive. This goes to the next level and for starters is filmed in perhaps 3 backdrops for the entire movie.You could be mistaken for calling this movie Ted and the Sorority house. 24 Hours of Ted, or even Ted's five seconds of sickening mayhem.Meant to be a homage for the victims of Ted Bundy more than anything else. The film is one that had no real value being made. There is not only nothing new here, but you will feel kinda sad watching Ted stalk and then bludgeon young girls to near death in a pretty sickening five to ten minute attack that seems to be the foundations of this entire movie In a nutshell. Other sequences of him imagining a girl ripping open her flesh before him giving himself pleasure are purely odd, and uncomfortableAgain the cover art on the DVD made it look like a slasher/killer teen flick taking place in an isolated cabin. But as soon as you know what the story is about then that was my time to leave it on the shelf, and slowly walk away.Thankfully the positive reprieve is the bleak seventy minute runtime because honesty there isn't and substance other than watching a deranged man get the chance to live out his sick and twisted fantasies for this brief period.The is nothing new you will learn and a story that has been regurgitated to the point of looking like colourless, odourless \"mass\" that begins to fester please I feel I write this review to save your time after I clearly wasted mine.1/10.",

We get chainsaw dismemberment, intestine fondling, and those familiar Japanese obsessions, upskirt shots and peeing, and yet it's all too absurd to be considered disturbing or shocking (although I still wouldn't recommend showing it to granny or the kids). Director Sade Satô's tendency to use tacky video filters and switch to monochrome for no reason is irritating: black and white gore is never very satisfying.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for the music. Recommended to fans of the later Guinea Pig films such as He Never Dies (1986) and Android of Notre Dame (1988).",

            "storyline": "Following a string of strange disappearances, a detective begins looking into a series of claims that revolve around a specific van following each of the victims prior to their going missing, and realizing that it's a prolific serial killer targeting a former stripper sets out to stop the rampage.This was a decently enjoyable if somewhat problematic entry in the series. Pretty much the main factor to this one is really the series of impressive stalking and kill scenes where everything that happens here involving the killer striking comes off effectively. Effectively portraying a ruthless, opportunistic psychopath who takes chances attacking in open spaces rather than taking them out in more secluded areas, this has some wholly impressive scenes where the ruthless energy brings about rapid-fire kill scenes with plenty of brutality and graphic gore to top it off. With impressive scenes involving him stalking victims in the stripclub, ambushing victims along the side of the road in their car, stalking an escaped victim through his factory hideout, or even featuring a fun car chase along the way, this has some fun moments throughout here which keeps the film moving along nicely with some generally fun moments with the killer. As well as a fun investigation angle looking into what's going on, these all manage to have a lot to like at points. There are some problems with the film that bring this one down. One of the biggest issues here is that the main killer in this one acts so over-the-top and outrageous that it's nearly impossible to believe the authorities haven't caught him yet. The sheer reckless nature of his antics repeating targets, staying in one location for his crimes, and picking the same pattern for his victims should all be such easy clues to spot the repeating pattern of what's he's doing yet it's so odd that everything takes a complete coincidence to figure out that it really feels quite hard to rationalize the detective taking as long as she does to figure out. Even though there's an attempt at throwing them off the trail with the staged discovery scene they find, the fact that so much of the film consists of his outwardly brutal and straightforward action with victims makes for an immensely sloppy killer even on top of the other small factors present including the guy driving around with bodies bleeding through it in plain daylight of others. It's somewhat distressing to see as it should be quite obvious what's going on but the way it works out is somewhat hard to figure out. The other issue with this one is the scattershot storyline that goes all over the place with plenty of useless tangents sticking out for no reason other than to beef up the running time.for no real reason. Having a lot of characters in the beginning makes for a tough time trying to figure out who we're supposed to be following as there's numerous stories going along at the stripclub with the various performers getting plenty of time that isn't necessary,especially with the dancer who gets fired for her attitude which just goes on way too long than it should and a secondary feature involving one of the workers having an under-the-radar drug business that has no purpose for existing other than adding bodies to the mix or making the owner an even more unlikable figure. These all manage to make a film that's far longer than it really should be with this going over an hour and forty minutes because it has so many excess storylines involved here that don't need it, which manage to be the big factors holding it down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, and sex scenes.",

Diet is the wrong term, as it is to be NO food until Easter, and she is then invited to stay longer. She has to share the room with Filipp, and it is clear he doesn't like her. Claudia says he has a personality disorder and often runs away. It is slow paced, very moody, and there are many undercurrents to the story. As Easter approaches, Stefan says he doesn't agree with the entire ritual, but it is very important to Claudia, so Simi should just go along with it. I can't really consider it a horror movie in the true sense, as there are no jump scares or other things associated with horror movies. It is decent movie, well acted but not really special.",

The only entertainment for the social media phenomenon characters is drinking, sexuality, meaningless gestures and conversations.

The other phenomena seem very selfish, self-absorbed. It's ridiculous that they just sit and stare while their friends are drowning. I liked the atmosphere where they are trapped in the house and it suddenly becomes tense. The production speeds up and slows down but the pace is good. The deaths are not very effective, so they could have been a bit more disturbing. The act are in tune with each other and make an effort to be believable. Cassandra Scerbo suits this kind of production and I find her successful. There could have been a different ending. An enjoyable slasher.",

So I literally didn't know what I was in for, aside from it being a horror movie of sorts. I was intrigued by the movie's title. And with it being a horror movie of sorts, then of course I had to watch it, given my love of all things horror.While \"Black Mold\" proved to be watchable, I have to say that I was disappointed with the script. It was a fairly empty script. And I have to say that I didn't understand why Brooke (played by Agnes Albright) and Tanner (played by Andrew Bailes) just simply didn't walk out from the building and just simply walk away. It made zero sense for them to remain in the building with the things that were happening. Plus, the storyline just wasn't all that impressive.The acting performances in the movie were fair, in all honesty. The only familiar face on the cast list, for me, was actor Jeremy Holm.Sure, I managed to sit through the entire 92 minutes that the movie ran for, but I was only mildly entertained. This is not a horror movie that will find its way back on my screen a second time, however, as there hardly was sufficient contents for the first viewing. Nor is it a movie that I would recommend horror afficianados to go out of their way to track down and watch.The movie was lacking a drive to engage the audience and invest themselves in the narrative and the characters. And the massive plot holes just wasn't really working out in favor of the movie.Ultimately, not a particularly outstanding or memorable movie, but a watchable movie. My rating of writer and director John Pata's \"Black Mold\" lands on a four out of ten stars.",

Beatriz is the daughter, who, with the servant woman, are the objects of the men's lust. To a lesser extent, so is the countess. Only the old hermit woman who can't even walk and babbles superstition doesn't have someone hoping to win her heart, though a few of them visit her to ask questions about the things they do not understand. The movie is slow paced for most of its running time. It seems less like a horror movie and more like a European coming of age film.",

But the movie was still fun to watch, I now bought the DVD of Scott's 2007 movie and will enjoy that next week-end. However, the fact that this \"producer\" steals an older movie is beyond my understanding and also the title which was used: Plane to Busan, clearly taking advantage of the totally fun movie Busanhaeng 2016 and sequel Busanhaeng 2: Bando, two superb South Korean high octane horror zombie thrillers.Of course, the movie is creditet to \"T. Scott\" but with no link to Thomas Scott and no other infos of the cast. And the title misleads you in the search. Anyway. Just wanted to give this info for this copy crap.Fazit: a shame.",

While Tokuzo Tanaka's film might feel a little redundant after the wonderful adaptation of the story in KWAIDAN, KAIDAN YUKI JOROU is still well worth a look for fans of Japanese folk horror.Extending the tale to eighty minutes doesn't feel like stretching it too thin; the feature-length story gets to focus more time on character development and crafting emotional connections, which helps the climax reach surprisingly emotive heights. You almost forget it's a horror flick in the middle, with the vibe lying somewhere between fantasy and family drama, but these portions don't drag like they could have.The film is beautifully shot and has some wonderfully memorable visual moments, especially near the end. These '60s Japanese horrors do such a wonderful job creating a spooky atmosphere, which is amplified by the setting and time period. It's like you're seven years old, telling ghost stories around the fire, except you're in rural Japan and wearing a kimono for some reason.It is rather predictable and features a lot of the missteps of Japanese cinema from this time period (overacting, a tendency towards ham-fisted asides and monologues, etc.), but if you enjoyed the likes of KWAIDAN and ONIBABA, this should tickle your fancy.",

This abruptly switches to anger (punching the wall until her hand is bloody), then bargaining (\"okay Grace, you get one chance...we'll try it your way\"), followed by depression (the despondent conversation in the library where she says she's incapable of happiness), and culminating in acceptance (finally seeing Edward's face in her visions; symbolically drowning the man she cheated with; writing out the \"Forgive + Forget\" message; letting go and floating upwards).",

The two films shared a few cast members and had the same production team, but different directors and screenwriters; Spiral (1998) was written and directed by Jôji Iida whereas Ring was written by Hiroshi Takahashi and directed by Hideo Nakata. After their release, Ring became an enormous success while Rasen floundered, quickly becoming the \"forgotten sequel\".",

            "storyline": "Arriving in Italy for a Bachelorette Party, a group of girlfriends rent out a manor house in the city for their celebrations which soon revolves around bringing the club owner who rents out the house back to party with them but when they discover his vampiric nature must try to stop his deadly plans.This was a pretty fun and generally solid genre outing. Among the better qualities here is the impressive work featured here that brings about a rather fun storyline. Managing to mix a slew of general cliches into workable storyline beats, starting with the bachelorette party arriving at the remote castle-like manor house in a foreign country, the interpersonal relationships between everyone who all have their backstory with the group to deal with, and the gradual reveal of the mysterious owner's past that becomes incredibly more obvious the more it continues features a strong enough starting point here. The later points brought up here involving the discovery of his plan the more they remain at the house, from the mythical portrait that looks exactly like her to the arrival of the hunter going through the sacred artifacts trying to uncover the truth about the host and his minions, serves to further this overall setup quite nicely. That makes the film incredibly fun when dealing with the vampiric action featured here. As there's a solid build-up to that point in the first half where his attempts at worming into their party to allow his presence and try to win her over, the work here featuring the group hanging around the manor or heading out to the party that brings them in contact with the main vampire and his cronies makes for an intriguing setup which brings this into the fun final half where the vampiric activity takes place. With the creatures taking over the house and using their powers to run wild over the friends who are twisted and manipulated into falling victim to the creatures in several fun setpieces that utilize the folklore powers well. Including the amount of fine confrontations to try to stop them which brings some decent gore throughout this part of the film and some well-handled sensuality with the seduction attempts, these provide quite a lot to like here. The film does have some issues here holding this down. The main drawback here is the series of obvious cliches utilized to try to tell this story but doesn't do much to differentiate it from the pack by using them. The starting point of the mysterious woman arriving there trying to look for her missing daughter which never gets resolved, the group being unconcerned with their missing friend who's never shown up, the painting featuring the one girl who's a dead ringer for the friend, and the revelation about the hunter following them has all manner of familiar beats that crop up in so many other similar films makes it all feel quite familiar. The other problem here is a slightly confusing issue during the main party where the vampires start to take over and use doppelgangers of the group which is never explained if it's a visual hallucination, manipulating the whole scenario, or a shapeshifting ability. It can make it hard to tell what's happening since any of those factors being the culprit changes around the scenario drastically. Beyond these factors, it's what drags this one down just slightly.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, and Brief Nudity.",

            "storyline": "This is a film I got see via screener thanks to Keir from Strike Media. It looks like this played at FrightFest over in the United Kingdom where I'm guessing it made its premiere. I'll be honest, outside of the title, the information that I shared here and then confirming it was horror, I came into seeing this blind.Synopsis: Sybil (Rebecca Calder) works as an undertaker. It's a lonely job, with a few perks so she takes solace where she can.We start this with a little girl finding a dead bird on the ground. She picks it up, puts it on her desk and then we see her preparing it. I figured she was doing a rough form of taxidermy. It seems that this girl grows up to be Sybil Chamberlain. We see her as an adult while driving. She hits an animal, then backs over it. She goes out for us to see it was a fox. We then see her cover it in a blanket and pick it up. She makes the comment that she's going to be late. We see that she recites poetry at an open mic night.Another character we meet runs a local mortuary, Mr. Thomas (James Fleet). He meets Sybil who is looking for work and he hires her. She inquires about a locked room that he has. He informs her not to worry about it, but it does have refrigeration.We then meet a police officer who is struggling named Helen (Jessica Yemi). She is put on leave as there seemed to be a tragic event in her life that she hasn't recovered from. Her boss knows she's drinking on the job and he cannot allow it. What we see is that this involved her son. There was an incident where she scolded him for knocking over milk. That is just the start of her guilt.Then the last character we meet is Mark (Jay Taylor). He is seeing Tina (Jelena Moore). Sybil meets him at a museum where we see that she daydreams about different things. It's love at first sight for her. That gets dashed when she realizes he has a girlfriend. Things take a dark turn when he suffers an accident. All these characters get tangled together and the deeper we get into the truth, the stranger things become.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that this was a hard film to settle into. I'll be honest, part of it is that this is from the United Kingdom and I didn't have subtitles. The accents were a bit difficult, but I did adjust. This sucked me in with the story and as things got revealed, it kept me guessing until the end. I will credit it for that. The last thing I'll include here is that this feels like a dark variation on something like Amélie.Now that I've set that up, what works for me is that we get a solid group of characters that we're following. Not only that, but this also gives you parts of their character or introduces a story element, then it shifts to someone else. I picked up early on that they were going to all connected, not necessarily in ways you'd expect. Seeing how they fit together is great and like I said, it goes into dark places. I did want to commend the editing here. It does take time to settle in, but once it does. I recommend going along for the ride.I'll also then say that this is a character study of the players involved. Something else to give credit to is that not everyone is as important as it sets up in the beginning. That wasn't something that I was expecting to be honest. To start breaking down characters, first is Sybil. She seems mousey in the beginning. The more we see her, the more we see that she's broken. Her family died in an accident when she was young. She is obsessed with death. She also just wants her happy ending. There are different things that break her façade and we also see she does depraved things. Credit to Calder for her performance.We then see her interactions with Mr. Thomas, who hires her. He sees and finds her to be a great worker, to the point that due to his age, he's considering promoting her already. This is positive. There are allusions to a dark secret he's harboring and it had me guessing until right before it was revealed. Good on the movie there. Fleet was good in his portrayal there. We also develop more of the Sybil character through Mark and Tina. It is there that we see how deep her psychosis goes. Both Taylor and Moore were also good in their roles. There's also a great reveal with Tina and a guy Sybil sees her with. That adds to the gut punch.Then the last character to bring up here is Helen. We know that she's struggling with drinking. It feels like the movie doesn't want us to like her. She does things that make me cringe. The more we learn about this, the more we see that what she's struggling with is something that most everyone would be. Her connection to Sybil was also interesting. This leads to the climax and resolution as well. I'll also say that Yemi was good in her portrayal as well.I'll say here that the rest of the cast was solid for what was needed in support. The best thing is seeing people in the delusions that Sybil lives in. I'll then just finish out with filmmaking. I thought this was well-made. The cinematography and framing of shots were good. What is great here is how Sybil's fantasies seem happy where the world she lives in is drabber. That's a good touch, especially at the climax. The limited effects that we got were good as well. I'll also say that the soundtrack suited what was needed.In conclusion, this was a film that once I settled into where the story was taking me, I was there for it. It reminds me of a dark variation on Amélie. This is a character study and seeing how this group are intertwined. The acting is good across the board. I thought how this was crafted was solid with the filmmaking aspects. The cinematography and framing lead the way there. My biggest issue was just needing subtitles as I think I missed things. If what I said sounds good, I'd recommend giving this a watch.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",

Among the few good features here is a solid and enjoyable starting point that manages to provide the kind of instigating factor for the investigation. With the whole affair starting with the wife's attack in the car that he has no way of preventing and featuring the kind of small-town hospitality years after to keep him in the job to catch the criminal responsible which becomes quite topical with the current attacks on townsfolk, the ability to build up a solid whodunnit mystery over the series of crimes being committed in the town makes for a fine setup here. Realizing it's a werewolf and starting to prepare for the occasion with some solid defensive tactics to protect the rest of the town as the final attacks are decent if not spectacular efforts with the low-budget limitations here keeping this one intriguing enough as it goes along. There are so many issues here beyond that as those low-budget limitations are at the center of it all. The fact that the budget here never allows for any kind of genuine attacks to take place on-screen where so many of them are based on a person reacting to being approached by a grunting, growling figure in a tinted vision to indicate something is happening but then switches to the aftermath to see what happened to the victim. This removes any potential suspense or action from the film not having any genuine genre fare present here, and with everything being wrapped in a low-budget haze of flimsy production values, special effects, and utterly nonsensical storylines for what's going on with so much of the film trying to paint him as the culprit it's hard to get invested in anything the film has a lot of issues.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",

LOVE CAMP 7 is an exploitation film set in a Nazi 'love camp' during the second World War. The film contains numerous scenes of women prisoners being abused, tortured and humiliated by their Nazi captors. Indeed the whole purpose of the work is to invite male viewers to relish the spectacle of naked women being humiliated for their titillation. LOVE CAMP 7 contains both eroticised depictions of sexual violence and repeated association of sex with restraint, pain, and humiliation. These sequences were in clear contravention of the Board's strict policy on depictions of sexual violence, which prohibits scenes that eroticise or endorse sexual assault. The possibility of cuts was considered. However, because the sexual violence runs throughout the work cutting was not considered to be a viable option'.",

Some of the movie stalls and is flat given its 1:35 hr run time.Overall I think it's a good efffort for some low budget horror. It's not going to blow you away but at the same time you can watch it and enjoy some solid acting and some good twists. 6/10.",

The last one that I enjoyed a most was conjuring. Wish I had a chance to watch it in the theatre however I saw it was available in Amazon Prime for rent. We decided to try it out in our little home theatre but worth a watch.The serial killer and all those beautiful girls who added life to this movie and the Art department, a very good movie.",

The room with the stormy waters outside in one scene, and barren landscape outside later on. I can only imagine the amount of work put into making this movie look like it does.So that's one thing. I'm having difficulties thinking of other things I liked with the movie. Some of the sequences drag on for way too long without really adding anything to the movie (as far as I can tell). I must admit that I'm not entirely sure what Lopushanskiy is trying to do or say in this movie. I guess it can be seen in light of communism and parts of the communists regimes. The elites being anti religion, and the people treated badly. But the religious aspect of it also brings my mind to Judaism. God's chosen people treated like animals. Maybe I'm being too specific, and he is trying to say something about man in general. But is it a message of hope? Or hopelessness? The movie was not able to hold my interest in the plot, and so I also lose interest in whatever message it is trying to convey.That said, it's worth watching for the visuals alone, and I'm sure other's will find more in the plot than I did. Maybe it helps knowing more about the context in which the movie was made?",

My jaw dropped open so often from watching this movie, I got cottonmouth!Cult director Christopher Bickel also tosses in a mushroom-soaked soundtrack that tries as hard to make you trip as some of the movie characters, who seem to think nothing of dosing unsuspecting visitors with psychedelics.

The plot is actually predictable. The ending has a decent twist, but the delivery feels lacking. Perhaps they aimed for an open-ending approach, but it didn't quite work for me.A 6/10 rating seems fair for this film. It's a great idea for an Indonesian movie, daring to be different from others.

He was a refreshing character, in full control of his \"curse\" and played off the villainous (yet gorgeous) she-werewolf. There is a female protagonist, but she is mostly there to have someone to explain the plot to.

It's almost funny. As a matter of fact, the better my acting was in some of the later scenes, the funnier film was. I found myself at the mercy of people who didn't know what they were doing. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but my feeling is, the producers destroyed it. Tobe could have made three different movies with material he had, and each one would have worked. But by the time he got it, it had changed from a love story to a suspense thriller about my character's paranoid fantasy, to a \"guy goes crazy\" film about this insane killer who becomes a destructive force that's going to wipe out mankind. We went back and kind of restructured it as a love story, but it didn't really help. The beginning of the film was great, and a certain portion of my stuff was fine, but then it became stupid when all the flame stuff started happening.\"",

Kawasaki sponsored the event, and offered a motorcycle as a prize to the audience member who wrote the best answer to \"I believe the Zodiac kills because...\" on yellow cards that were handed out at the door. Hanson set up a team of people to analyze each entry for handwriting that matched that of the killer, and planned to confront them in the lobby if a match was found.One particular night, Hanson encountered a man who according to him closely resembled the famous wanted poster sketch and had submitted more than one entry, despite warning the staff against providing multiple ones per person. Due to the fact that the employee who was concealed in the submission box was incapacitated; Hanson had some other employees present seize the man, who reportedly didn't even act surprised when grabbed. Hanson then personally confronted him, claiming to be Zodiac victim Paul Stine's brother. The man nonchalantly responded that he was sorry to hear about Stine's murder, and ultimately, he was let go. The next day, Hanson found that the man was staying in a nearby hotel, and was apparently a Vietnam veteran. He was convinced that the man was The Zodiac and even claims to have received several letters from the killer later on, which were confiscated by the Police. Since the contest to win the motorcycle was largely a sham, no one ever \"won\" the prize, and Hanson eventually gave it away to a friend of his.",

One of the stronger features is a truly enjoyable and immersive setup that features a lot of interconnecting parts that come together rather well. Starting with the background of her mother dying in mysterious circumstances while living in the community that she's long since been estranged from, this provides the means of establishing the motive to return as well as giving enough of their background with each other. Since we're aware of the relationship presented and how that affects her, the desire to reconnect with everyone once she arrives to figure out the cause is a natural part of their reunion. It also makes the presence of the community's behavior and rituals seem like the perfect choice to enhance this type of story by appearing as quaint customs before gradually appearing darker and more ominous. That brings about a fantastic sense of looming dread the longer the two stay around the community with the increasing danger leading to more thrills. This setup helps the film become far more fun once the ominous instincts start coming to fruition. With the low-key nature revolving around the community's good-natured if slightly off-kilter behavior or just noticing ritualistic decorations left behind, this is nice enough to serve the film until it gets to the more overt sequences later on once she's left alone in the apartment. The big sequence plays as a form of bizarre meal-prep with the gathered family members and others she's met in the community performing what appears to be a ritualistic ceremony designed to prepare her for a special occult ritual that soon turns into a nightmarish fever dream that she can't tell her dream from reality is quite impressive. It starts the remaining part of this one into a much darker genre effort that includes several reveals about the visions she's been experiencing, leading to the wild finale where the dark origins of the ceremony are revealed as it's all about bringing the new spirit into a hosts' body which is again more low-key than expected but still manages some generally chilling visuals and chases around the complex. These all bring about a lot to like here as although there aren't too many drawbacks present here several issues do crop up. Among the main factors is the sense of confusion present here since very little is explained. As the first half is much more ominous and low-key than anything, there's not much in the way of revealing what's going on, preferring to remain focused on the haunting atmosphere of the building as well as their ominous behavior to generate the scares almost exclusively. As a result, hardly anything gets revealed about what the community is trying to do, what their ritual entails, or how everything is supposed to be carried out so very little gets brought up. It's not until the end that anything comes together so there's a chance for this to be somewhat confusing at the start to get into what's going on. The other detriment is that this setup allows for a rather slow-going first half as well and very little happens beyond setting up the storylines which are paid off in the ending so this takes a while to get its point out. These are the few minor drawbacks on display with this one.Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Language.",

Lets get real here, the exploitation of aloof and ignorant Rednecks in horror has been abused heavily in the past. Strangestuff goes there once again, and they somehow manage to splice that overused concept with dashes of Revenge of the Nerds, Star Trek, and the Blob. The jokes run thick, and teeter between insanely funny and obliviously bad. All in all, I can see this oddball flick becoming a cult classic.",

Several scenes and performances were very strong and the videography was stunning (especially the drone views of the treetops and the incredible shots of the moon).

And has some people in it I personally know.The movie is therefor worse than the sum of its parts. It knows it is not a masterpiece, it knows it is or rather tries to be close to Ed Wood. The acting is miserable at best though. You realize that to act like you can't act ... you have to be able to act. And that ability is lacking in many participants here.Again you have to take everything with a grain of salt - actually with a whole sack of salt. Maybe a ton of it? Ok kidding aside (or am I?), the movie is as low as it goes. There are some nicer things, like the throwback blood - the 70s called and ... I don't think they want it back - they probably even offered that completely fake blood - a nod I assume to that era. There is also some nudity - and there is a bow and arrow woman who is criminally underrepresented in the movie - no pun intended.There are some outtakes during the credits that won't make or break your experience ... if you even made it that far.

While the story was a little unbelievable at times, it was still enjoyable with a pretty good ending that brought tension to it. I hope Tubi keep doing movies like this with solid stories and good acting. One thing I did like though was even though there were a few interesting kills, the gore was kept to a minimum, the story concentrated on the mystery rather than the violence.

The only problems I had with the movie: 1) The movie never tells what happened with that girl who got killed  2) Why did the daughter just forgive this woman for having an affair with her father, and why would she suggest they move in together?

As I munched the film began to unveil its intricate storyline.I was reminded of a Romereo classic film , it beat American warewold in london since this was so much more complicated with better acting.It was riveting .As the credits came up I knew I had watched a classic , one which will be remembered and talked about in the decades to follow. It was classic.",

It's a slow burner and relies more on atmosphere than the usual installments in the genre. There are very few characters - the story is set around a very recently blinded man and a very pregnant lady. The ending was predictable, but if you're a fan of the genre you're likely forgiving of such things. The acting & special effects were fine.

Tongue-in-cheek, timeless, pedal to the metal, with lore and gore and creatures galore, this unique daffy adventure put a goofy open smile on my face.It's so enjoyable to see an independent genre concoction that feels like it's being informed by a filmmaker following their bliss.As well as a fun cutloose star vehicle for great American acting treasure Robert Miano who can be in anything from THE BOOK OF DANIEL to FAST & FURIOUS to GIRLS TRIP to DEATH WISH to DONNIE BRASCO and anything in between.Whether you're into Lovecraft or not, whether you've seen THE DEEP ONES or not, whether you consider yourself a fan of horror or not, whether you want to laugh with a movie or at it or near it or whichever preposition you prefer, there's 84 minutes of giddy fun here.",

The soundtrack and camera work was reminiscent of Italian giallo, so fans of this will be pleasantly surprised by what you get. The build up was very good and relies on solid tension and suspense, over character development. It all unfolds in a very satisfactory way that will please most horror fans. Don't go into it expecting something brilliant. Just be prepared to leave your brain at the door and go along on the ride of terror as our main character tries to find a way out of her dilemma.",

The ghost actors are on a black velvet background so you can control the density of their image as you shoot, ie you fade them in and fade them out and line them up easily with the 'live' actors. It worked very well, and of course you could see the composite dailies next day. Eventually we got this technique down to a fine art.

And with my love of both the Asian cinema and horror cinema, of course it was a given that I had to watch this movie from director Yong-Ki Jeong.However, my expectations and thrills for a possibly interesting horror movie were shot down not far into the movie. Writers Yong-ki Jeong and Soyoung Lee managed to put together a rather confusing heap of a dumpsterfire disguised as a horror movie. Yeah, the movie made very little sense and it was quite a struggle to sit through it. In fact, I gave up on the ordeal with just 30 minutes left to watch. But I have to admit that by then I was ready to claw my eyes out.\"Ogsuyeog Gwisin\" was a swing and a miss, and for a South Korean horror movie it was sort of a farce. I assume because it was based on some Japanese material from Kôji Shiraishi and Hiroshi Takahashi, and the translation between the two cultures didn't really pan out all that well.I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in \"Ogsuyeog Gwisin\", but I have to admit that my interest in the narrative was so vague and gradually dissipating more and more with each passing minute the narrative trotted on. So I wasn't really impressed with what I saw, but I suppose that the acting performances were adequate, because none of them stood out as being amateurish or bad actually.There were a couple of attempts at cheap jumpscares throughout the course of the 80 minutes that the ordeal lasted for. Not successful jumpscared, mind you, but at least director Yong-Ki Jeong tried.If you enjoy South Korean horror movies, you might want to consider giving \"Ogsuyeog Gwisin\" a wide berth. Trust me, it is not worth the time, money or effort.My rating of \"Ogsuyeog Gwisin\" lands on a generous three out of ten stars, and that is mostly because of the production value of the movie and the cinematography.",

Eugen Mogk provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name Perchta to the Old High German verb pergan, meaning \"hidden\" or \"covered\". Perchta is often identified as stemming from the same Germanic goddess as Holda and other female figures of German folklore (see Frija-Frigg). According to Jacob Grimm and Lotte Motz, Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of \"guardian of the beasts\" and appear during the Twelve Days of Christmas, when they oversee spinning.\nGrimm says Perchta or Berchta was known \"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\"",

Outside of the trinket box being passed around there wasn't a real connection made to the beginning. If the theme was nothing more than old racism still exists then they nailed it. Otherwise, this movie disappointingly left a lot on the table for me. I would not recommend it. Someone else said they were left on the edge of their seat.

The executions are not without method. Victims are either obstacles, nuisances, or detriments, many times justified.Loomis develops an attitude problem, glomming the talkshow circuit promoting his over-embellished book The Devil's Eyes without consideration for the privacy of those involved, revealing certain personal information without permission, causing Angel Myers {baby sister} much consternation, to the point of heavy drinking with her promiscuous rocker friends. None other than Weird Al makes an appearance as a guest.Despite this exploitation, Loomis remains a crucial personage to gain both an understanding, and nominally controlling factors.One remarkable scene yields a harkening to that evocatively iconic display of primal strength exhibited by THE HULK flipping the car, but Meyers instead. Staged pre-2k, many such Gen X references herein.Some nubile nudity. Interestingly enough, Michael can actually be heard producing atypical guttural sounds from time to time during killings, while he's usually silent, as in silent death.KILL COUNT: 22._____________\n* can symbolize innocence and purity, good fortune, or prosperity.",

Mostly used as backdrops or enhancements, they are quite noticable and the beginning of this film in particular, it was almost too much. After the opening scenes, they weren't so blatantly obvious though.The action scenes could've used a bit more finesse as they looked very choreographed.The story here is decent but it lacks depth and detail. There's enough to keep you engaged but I kept waiting for things to be explained more. I was disappointed that the rituals were not explained but they were still intriguing.My guess is that there may be sequel to this and if so, I liked this enough to want to see what else may happened.

The torture as well may I add is genital and deeply unpleasant.Well, that's it. No I mean literally no storyline just several scenes as I described. No heroine, no fighting back, just back to back scenes of these disgusting acts.I question the mentality of someone who would make this. Torture porn movies as people often refer to them as still have a storyline, characters and a purpose! This is essentially nothing short of snuff.The film has no purpose at all and is one of the most pitiful things I've ever seen.For a man involved in such big projects you'd think he would have a) the money to make something better and b) a handle on Hollywood and what will/won't succeed.Disgusting, vile, travesty to the industry.The Good: NothingThe Bad: EverythingThings I learnt from this film:Never to watch anything else made by Ryan Nicholson",

It became extra special this year because two Filipino films was part of the line up and Nanay, Tatay was one of them.With curiousity and anticipation, we watched Nanay, Tatay first. I expected less because I have never watched a memorable and impressive Filipino horror movie for the longest time.Let me start by saying that the cinematography was brilliant. The lighting and location really added beauty in this film. Next is the sound effects, it gave me something that either made me scared or made me nervous. The story is unique and it was told effectively. The twist was the best for me.To cap it off, the acting was really convincing. The ensemble really played a great part in making this movie a hit (no wonder the movie play date got extended even after the film festival schedule). Big kudos to Andrea del Rosario and Jeffrey Hidalgo (Nanay, Tatay respectively) for conveying emotions that this film required, but the spotlight goes to Elia Ilano who played Malena. She is the star of this movie! Elia effortlessly embodies the eerie, otherworldly presence, bringing a chilling intensity to every scene. Her ability to convey a sense of deep sorrow and malevolence with just a glance or subtle gesture is remarkable. Even without speaking, her body language and eye contact communicates a haunting vulnerability and raw power, making her an unforgettable presence on screen. She can be compared to Lotus Feet and Tiyanak as an iconic Pinoy horror movie character.I hope to see more Filipino movies like this. Round of applause to their director, Roni Benaid.",

Same atmosphere, same country setting, same slow build to nowhere.It's just not original and becomes rather tedious to watch very early on.As an example of the mindless boredom, there is a scene right at the beginning where a woman stares at another woman drinking tea for literally 5 minutes.We get to watch her drink an entire cup. And not the little 6 ounce cups that are regular servings. This is a mug of tea.Pouring mollasses is faster than the pace of this movie. And makes more sense. At least the mollasses goes somewhere.The music is very inappropriate too. It's all mystical when nothing is happening!It all boils down to this -- the actors arent the problem.

While the cinematography is passable and the audio could benefit from more refinement, the film excels in its storytelling. It weaves a compelling narrative of love, loss, and redemption set against the timeless battle of good versus evil. Mace, reminiscent of Neo from \"The Matrix,\" adds depth to the protagonist's journey, while the sleek suits evoke a sense of intrigue akin to agents. Tara's performance as Zia is a stand out, along with several other performances in the film. Overall, \"Oculus\" stands out for its unique storyline and meaningful message, making it a noteworthy watch accessible to audiences worldwide.",

This is definitely a step in the right direction for the creator and hopefully a learning experience which will lead to bigger and better projects down the line. But all that being said, I cannot recommend this film as entertainment value on any level.Despite its tongue-in-cheek title, Pillow Party Massacre never becomes the silly 80's-inspired romp that it keeps on promising to be.The script is thinner than most direct-to-video horror films would allow their own script to be. Every line of dialogue in this film is soulless exposition, and none of the characters have any personality or identity. By the end of the film I couldn't remember a single character's name, and the few moments where the screenplay tries to be meta are lazy and uncommitted. You can tell that the filmmakers have intended to make their own version of Scream without the wit, knowhow or brilliance that made that film work. And the resulting project is soulless, boring and so glacially paced that the short running time felt phenomenally longer than it actually was.The film is also riddled with technical flaws. The CGI looks unbelievably cheap and not in an ironic way, and the majority of the kills look incredibly fake without it even being humourous. There are way too many dance sequences in the film which drag on for way too long with the intro scene being the most notable example, and the camera seems to linger on the feet and legs of the characters for an uncomfortably long amount of time as if the director of photography has some kind of strange fetish. The colour grading is terribly off, the sound editing is consistently weak, there are numerous lines of dialogue that are obviously dubbed or sometimes layered multiple times out of order, and the cinematography seems to be using a camera that operates on a steadycam gimble yet also manages to shake all the time. Why you would shake the camera whilst also trying to steady it goes completely beyond me, it's like ordering a diet coke with a side of sugar.Ultimately, the film is just boring. It was made with the best intentions but without proper expertise or a screenplay worth filming. I didn't laugh, I wasn't scared, I wasn't entertained. This film is no massacre, it's a drag.",

            "storyline": "This is a movie that I was intrigued when I heard that it featured Joe Bob Briggs aka John Bloom. I also saw Justin M. Seaman hanging around at the film festival. He is a filmmaker that learned about from his films: The Barn and its sequel. When I made the connection that he was part of this, I was in. I've seen a good number of documentaries about cryptids so I was intrigued to check this out. This was the Ohio premiere as well.Synopsis: an anthology film about a paranormal radio show that accepts calls from individuals who have met creatures from the unknown.Now this anthology has a wraparound story that involves Harlan Dean (Bloom) who is the host of a radio show called Truth Serum. They're in Point Pleasant, WV for the celebration of the Mothman. He takes callers who tell him different stories.What I like about each one is that they're involving an urban legend about cryptids that are believed to be out there. The first one is involving 'Melonheads'. This short has two couples sleeping in tents to help Heather (Sable Griedel) get over her fear. Matt (Chad Bruns) is friends with her boyfriend. He's also a jerk. What he says doesn't help the situation as he talks about different creepy entities living in the woods. This puts fear back to Heather. It is amplified when they hear things calling out in the night.The next story is about 'Bigfoot'. A park ranger and his partner find a woman in the middle of the woods. It looks like she's been attacked. They try to help her as well as journeying deeper after they come face-to-face with one of these animals. What they discover is that it might not be alone.Our third story brings things to Ohio where this is a guy called Buckeye Joe. He tells the odd story of a cryptid hunter named Oren who has a crazy encounter with 'The Loveland Frogman'. This encounter brings a night he will never forget.We then have a story around Halloween where a son comes home to visit his dad with his girlfriend. Credit to her for showing off her body a bit. That is despite thinking her boyfriend's dad might be a bit odd with his love of horror stuff. This is about 'Hopkinsville Goblins' which I believe are aliens from what I gathered. It also isn't the first time that dad encountered these monsters.The next story is then 'Chupacabra Death Machines'. A barber, Esau Ramirez, tells the story of how the Mexican cartel is using this legendary beast to hunt for sport and taking bets on which one will get the job done. The barber also wants to remain anonymous for fear of what could happen to him if it gets out that he talked.Then the final story is about 'The Beast of Bladenboro'. Two friends and one of the guy's sisters are hunting down this monster. It might be too much for them to manage as they come face to face with a monster that is unbelievable.We do come back to Harlan in between segments. He might also have an encounter of his own. There is also a reason that he is getting these people on the phone to tell their stories.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to each of these stories. Since I saw this in the theater, my notes are limited. What I think I'll do since each one has different filmmakers is give each a run through and then tally up the average score at the end. I'll start here then with the wraparound. I love that they got Bloom for Harlan. He is perfect for this role. He is a guy that I'd love to just talk with and hear stories. I also like that there could be a story involving him with Mothman, Mr. Cold and a man in black, Wayne W. Johnson. This sets the stage and helps bridge the stories.The first story surrounding the Melonheads was good. These are one of the creepier ones that are used. There is a good set up to get our group outside with Heather needing to overcome her fears. She is the strongest performer here. The rest of the cast is okay. I love the look of the Melonheads. That was creepy. The blood and gore that we saw was good as well. Solid short to set the tone here. I also like that her nurse, Lana (Jordan Beltz), is the one calling it in to Harlan.What they did with the Bigfoot one was also good. I don't necessarily know if we needed the woman being attacked as part of it. I do understand how that plays into things later. What I like is that this duo meets one of these creatures, shoots it and then follows. This proves to be disastrous. What is also interesting is the explanation here as to why bones of these cryptids aren't found. The acting here worked and I thought the effects were good. Love the suits used for the monsters.One that I didn't necessarily care for would be about the Loveland Frogman. This goes a bit too whimsical. It made me laugh at times. Credit there to the actor playing Oren. I think this would be served a bit better if we got to learn a bit more about this cryptid as this was just a wild one that I don't know much about.Now one that held the tone much better for me was Hopkinsville Goblins. We have a solid set up of this son, bringing his girlfriend home to spend Halloween with his dad. I'll bring up again that the girlfriend was quite attractive and seeing her in her underwear was good. Not sure why that needed to be here other than entertainment. The monsters here are great. They are quite Gremlins, Ghoulies or Critters like. This one also had the best soundtrack for what I remembered.A short that I thought had more promise but came up a bit short for me was Chupacabra Death Machines. I love the idea here that the Mexican cartel has these creatures and using them for what they are. That is great. It is also terrifying. The effects here I wanted a bit more. From what I remember, this went a bit too CGI heavy. These beasts also looked like dogs. A bit more care I think could have made this stronger. The acting was solid though.Then the last short being The Beast of Bladenboro. This one I thought was quite interesting, what they did here. I remember there being a stinger in this that caught my attention. This has that plotline of a joke gone wrong and then the truth of the matter coming to a head. I remember the friend here being hilarious, so I'll credit the acting. I thought this was one of the better ones here for sure.In conclusion, this was a solid anthology involving different cryptids. I like the fact that we have got a solid grouping of ones that I've heard of and ones that are a bit lesser known. The idea of having different filmmakers make each one interesting. It does make for a bit uneven of tone though as well. Overall, I think that all these are solid. Tweaks here and there for me could have made this better. If you're a cryptid fan and want to see a decent anthology involving them, give this a watch. Be warned, it is a lower budget. I still think the effects are strong almost completely across the board.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",
